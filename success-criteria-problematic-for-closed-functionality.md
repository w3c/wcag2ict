Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality
-----------------------------------------------------

<div class="ednote">This section has been updated to add notes for new WCAG 2.1 criteria that are problematic for Closed Functionality. 
  
In the next public draft, the WCAG2ICT Task Force will remove obsolete criteria and add new WCAG 2.2 criteria if any are problematic for Closed Functionality. The Task Force may also make updates to existing WCAG 2.0 content in this section to reflect new insights learned since the 2013 WCAG2ICT Note.</div>

There are Success Criteria that can be problematic for developers of closed functionality. Some criteria discuss making information available in text (which can be read by assistive technologies), making it “programmatically determinable” (rendered by a user agent and readable by assistive technologies), or doing something else to make content compatible with assistive technologies. Other Success Criteria would apply to systems with closed functionality either if they are partially closed or if they allow for the connection of some types of devices. As an example, Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard would apply to systems which are closed to screen readers, but have a physical keyboard or a connector for standard keyboards. While these criteria, as written, are not always applicable to closed functionality, most of them can inform and aid development of built-in features needed to make closed functionality products accessible. For non-web software on closed functionality products, alternate accessibility provisions might be needed to cover the user needs addressed by the following Success Criteria:

<ul>
<li><a href="#non-text-content">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a> — Requires text or a text alternative in a programmatically determinable form.</li>
<li><a href="#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded">1.2.1 Pre-recorded video</a> — One of the options available to authors for success criterion 1.2.1 is providing a media alternative that is text which, in the absence of connected assistive technology, would need to be made available in different modalities.</li>
<li><a href="#audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded">1.2.3 Audio description or Media Alternative</a> — One of the options available to authors for success criterion 1.2.3 is providing a media alternative that is text which, in the absence of connected assistive technology, would need to be made available in different modalities.</li>
<li><a href="#info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a> — Requires information in a programmatically determinable form.</li>
<li><a href="#meaningful-sequence">1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence</a> — Requires information in a programmatically determinable form. Instead, a closed functionality software equivalent would be to provide a meaningful reading sequence through auditory output or some other non-visual means that helps users correlate the output with the corresponding information displayed on the screen.</li>
<li><a href="#orientation">1.3.4 Orientation</a> — Closed functionality products that have fixed-in-place displays or other limitations to modifying the physical display orientation are covered under the essential exception and are not required to provide support for orientation changes. See the note in the section <a href="#applying-sc-1-3-4-orientation-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 1.3.4 Identify Input Purpose to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#identify-input-purpose">1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose</a> — Requires information in a programmatically determinable form; in the absence of programmatic capabilities, text labels need to be specific and be provided to the user in other modalities (e.g. auditory).</li>
<li><a href="#audio-control">1.4.2 Audio Control</a> — The intent of this success criterion is to avoid interference of audio with assistive products, which are not available in a system with closed functionality. But if the built-in accessibility features of the closed system provide speech output, then the interference may happen and this SC applies. In addition, there are existing closed functionality requirements in standards such as the EN 301 549 and U.S. Revised 508 Standards (402.3 Volume) that cover volume control for closed functionality products.</li>
<li><a href="#contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a> — There are cases where applying this Success Criterion to non-web software on closed functionality products is problematic:
<ul>
<li>When the contrast of the content is determined by the hardware and not modifiable by the software author, it may not be possible to meet this Success Criterion.
<div class="note">Hardware requirements for contrast are out of scope for WCAG2ICT (and this Success Criterion).</div></li>
<li>When the color contrast ratio cannot be programmatically measured due to system limitations (e.g. lockdown), precise quantifiable testing of color contrast cannot be performed by a third party. In such cases, the software author would need to confirm that the color combinations used meet the contrast requirement.
<div class="note">Photographs are not sufficient for testing that content meets this Success Criterion. This is because the quality of the lighting, camera, and physical aspects of the hardware display can dramatically affect the ability to capture the content for testing purposes.</div></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a>—because the text rendering support in a closed environment may be more limited than the support found in user agents for the Web, meeting Success Criterion 1.4.4 in a closed environment may place a much heavier burden on the content author;</li>
<li><a href="#images-of-text">1.4.5 Images of Text</a>—because there is no need to impose a requirement on all closed functionality that text displayed on the screen actually be represented internally as text (as defined by WCAG 2), given that there is no interoperability with assistive technology;</li>
<li><a href="#reflow">1.4.10 Reflow</a> — Many closed functionality products do not allow users to modify the viewport or change font sizes, so there would be no need to impose a requirement on all closed functionality that content is able to reflow. Additionally, many closed functionality products do not display large chunks of text and only have UI controls; in such cases, two-directional scrolling to access the text and UI controls may be considered essential.</li>
<li><a href="#non-text-contrast">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a> — There are cases where applying this Success Criterion to non-web software on closed functionality products is problematic:
<ul>
<li>When the contrast of the content is determined by the hardware and not modifiable by the software author, it may not be possible to meet this Success Criterion.
<div class="note">Hardware requirements for contrast are out of scope for WCAG2ICT (and this Success Criterion).</div></li>
<li>When the color contrast ratio cannot be programmatically measured due to system limitations (e.g. lockdown), precise quantifiable testing of color contrast cannot be performed by a third party. In such cases, the software author would need to confirm that the color combinations used meet the contrast requirement.
<div class="note">Photographs are not sufficient for testing that content meets this Success Criterion. This is because the quality of the lighting, camera, and physical aspects of the hardware display can dramatically affect the ability to capture the content for testing purposes.</div></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#text-spacing">1.4.12 Text Spacing</a> — In closed functionality software the ability for users to modify line, paragraph, letter, or word spacing is rarely supported. However, if encountered, the Success Criterion applies as noted in the <a href="#applying-sc-1-4-12-text-spacing-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 1.4.12 Text Spacing to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#keyboard">2.1.1 Keyboard</a>—Requires operation via a keyboard interface which allows alternative input devices. When a product with closed functionality either does not have a standard keyboard or one cannot be connected, it would need an alternate way to access all functionality that does not require accurate pointing, path-based movements, or specific timings.</li>
<li><a href="#bypass-blocks">2.4.1 Bypass Blocks</a> — The WCAG2ICT interpretation of this success criterion replaces "sets of Web pages" with "sets of software programs" which are extremely rare - especially for closed functionality software. However, being able to bypass blocks of content that are repeated within software is generally considered best practice.</li>
<li><a href="#page-titled">2.4.2 Page Titled</a>—Where the software is part of a product that provides a single function, or has a menu-driven interface, there is no need for a title.</li>
<li><a href="#multiple-ways">2.4.5 Multiple Ways</a>—The WCAG2ICT interpretation of this Success Criterion replaces "set of Web pages" with "set of software programs." Such sets, particularly in the context of closed functionality software, are exceedingly rare. There are a number of notes in the section <a href="#applying-sc-2-4-5-multiple-ways-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 2.4.5 Multiple Ways to Non-Web Documents and Software</a> that are applicable to closed functionality software.</li>  
<li><a href="#pointer-cancellation">2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation</a>—As noted in the section <a href="#applying-sc-2-5-2-pointer-cancellation-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>, examples of 'essential' functionality are features for meeting environmental energy usage requirements (like waking a device from sleep, power saver mode, and low power state).</li>  
<li><a href="#label-in-name">2.5.3 Label in Name</a>—Requires information in a programmatically determinable form; specifically, the programmatic name contains the text of the visual label.</li>
<li><a href="#language-of-page">3.1.1 Language of Page</a>—Requires language information in a programmatically determinable form intended to drive correct pronunciation. Where another mechanism achieves correct pronunciation for closed functionality, such as self-voicing, the intent of this success criterion would be met.</li>
<li><a href="#language-of-parts">3.1.2 Language of Parts</a>—Requires language information in a programmatically determinable form intended to drive correct pronunciation. Where another mechanism achieves correct pronunciation for closed functionality, such as self-voicing, the intent of this success criterion would be met.</li>
<li><a href="#consistent-navigation">3.2.3 Consistent Navigation</a>—This Success Criterion is interpreted to only apply to "sets of software programs" which are very rare. See the second note in the section <a href="#applying-sc-3-2-3-consistent-navigation-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#consistent-identification">3.2.4 Consistent Identification</a>—This Success Criterion is interpreted to only apply to "sets of software programs" which are very rare. See the second note in the section <a href="#applying-sc-3-2-4-consistent-identification-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 3.2.4 Consistent Identification to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#error-identification">3.3.1 Error Identification</a>—while it's important for errors that can be detected to be described to the user, for closed functionality, the error description doesn't have to be provided in text, as defined in WCAG 2;</li>
<li><a href="#name-role-value">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>—requires information in a programmatically determinable form.</li>
<li><a href="#status-messages">4.1.3 Status Messages</a>—requires information in a programmatic determinable form. Additionally, software with closed functionality is not typically implemented using markup languages.
<div class="note">Non-web software with closed functionality would need equivalent facilitation to provide access to status messages.</div></li>
</ul>
