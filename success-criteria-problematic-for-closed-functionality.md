Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality
-----------------------------------------------------

There are Success criteria that can be problematic for developers of closed functionality. Some criteria discuss making information available in text (which can be read by assistive technologies), making it “programmatically determinable” (rendered by a user agent and readable by assistive technologies), or doing something else to make content compatible with assistive technologies. Other Success Criteria would apply to systems with closed functionality either if they are partially closed or if they allow for the connection of some types of devices. As an example, Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard would apply to systems which are closed to screen readers, but have a physical keyboard or a connector for standard keyboards. While these criteria, as written, are not suitable for closed functionality, most of them can inform and aid development of built-in features needed to make closed functionality products accessible. For non-web software on closed functionality products, alternate accessibility provisions might be needed to cover the user needs addressed by the following Success Criteria:

<ul>
<li><a href="#non-text-content">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a>—Requires text or a text alternative in a programmatically determinable form.</li>
<li><a href="#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded">1.2.1 Pre-recorded video</a>—One of the options available to authors for success criterion 1.2.1 is that of providing a media alternative that is text—which necessarily relies on a connected assistive technology to be presented.</li>
<li><a href="#audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded">1.2.3 Audio description or Media Alternative</a>—One of the options available to authors for success criterion 1.2.3 is that of providing a media alternative that is text—which necessarily relies on a connected assistive technology to be presented.</li>
<li><a href="#info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>—Requires information in a programmatically determinable form.</li>
<li><a href="#meaningful-sequence">1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence</a>—Requires information in a programmatically determinable form; a correct reading sequence should be output that helps the user correlate information that is provided auditorially or through some other non-visual means with the corresponding information displayed on the screen.</li>
<li><a href="#orientation">1.3.4 Orientation</a>—Some closed functionality products have fixed-in-place displays or other limitations to modifying the physical display orientation. See the note in the section <a href="#guidance-when-applying-success-criterion-1-3-4-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Guidance When Applying Success Criterion 1.3.4 to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.
<li><a href="#identify-input-purpose">1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose</a>—Requires information in a programmatically determinable form; text labels need to be specific and be provided to the user in other modalities (e.g. auditory).</li>
<li><a href="#audio-control">1.4.2 Audio Control</a>—There are existing closed functionality requirements in standards such as the EN 301 549 and U.S. Revised 508 Standards (<a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#402.3">402.3 Volume</a>) that cover volume control for closed functionality products.  Since there is no AT (by definition) in a closed functionality product, there is no potential for conflict between self-voiced content and screen reader audio. To avoid potential conflicts between the volume control requirements, this WCAG requirement should not be applied to closed functionality software.</li>
<li><a href="#contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>—There are cases where applying this Success Criterion to non-web software on closed functionality products is problematic:</li>
<ul>
  <li>When the appearance of the content is determined by the hardware and not modifiable by the software author, the non-web software would meet the exception for this Success Criterion.</li>
  <div class="note">
    <p>Hardware requirements for contrast are out of scope for WCAG2ICT (and this Success Criterion), but do exist in other standards' requirements for closed functionality products (e.g. EN 301 549 and Revised 508 Standards).</p>
  </div>
  <li>When the color contrast ratio cannot be programmatically measured due to system limitations (e.g. lockdown), precise quantifiable testing of color contrast cannot be performed by a third party. In such cases, the software author would need to confirm that the color combinations used meet the contrast requirement.</li>
  <div class="note">
    <p>Photographs are not sufficient for testing that content meets this Success Criteria. This is because the quality of the lighting, camera, and physical aspects of the hardware display can dramatically affect the ability to capture the content for testing purposes.</p>
  </div>
</ul>
<li><a href="#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a>—Because the text rendering support in a closed environment may be more limited than the support found in user agents for the Web, meeting Success Criterion 1.4.4 in a closed environment may place a much heavier burden on the content author. Therefore, some closed functionality products are unable to support resizing of text, in which case a minimum text size is a sensible alternative requirement. This is the approach taken by both the EN 301 549 and the US Revised 508 Standards.</li>
<li><a href="#images-of-text">1.4.5 Images of Text</a>—because there is no need to impose a requirement on all closed functionality that text displayed on the screen actually be represented internally as text (as defined by WCAG 2.2), given that there is no interoperability with assistive technology;</li>
<li><a href="#reflow">1.4.10 Reflow</a>—Many closed functionality products do not allow users to modify the viewport or change font sizes, so there would be no need to impose a requirement on all closed functionality that content is able to reflow. Additionally, many closed functionality products do not display large chunks of text and only have UI controls. In such cases, two-directional scrolling to access the text and UI controls may be considered essential.</li>
<li><a href="#non-text-contrast">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a>—There are cases where applying this Success Criterion to non-web software on closed functionality products is problematic:</li>
<ul>
<li>When the appearance of the content is determined by the hardware and not modifiable by the software author, the non-web software would meet the exception for this Success Criterion.</li>
<div class="note">Hardware requirements for contrast are out of scope for WCAG2ICT (and this Success Criterion), but do exist in other standards' requirements for closed functionality products (e.g. EN 301 549 and Revised 508 Standards).</div>
<li>When the color contrast ratio cannot be programmatically measured due to system limitations (e.g. lockdown), precise quantifiable testing of color contrast cannot be performed by a third party. In such cases, the software author would need to confirm that the color combinations used meet the contrast requirement.</li>
<div class="note">Photographs are not sufficient for testing that content meets this Success Criteria. This is because the quality of the lighting, camera, and physical aspects of the hardware display can dramatically affect the ability to capture the content for testing purposes.</div>
</ul>
<li><a href="#text-spacing">1.4.12 Text Spacing</a>—Applicability of this Success Criterion to closed functionality software is limited to software implemented using markup languages, which is rare. Closed functionality technologies also rarely support user modification of line line, paragraph, letter or word spacing. Therefore, there is no need to impose this requirement on all closed functionality software.</li>
<li><a href="#content-on-hover-or-focus">1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus</a>—It would be rare for closed functionality software to trigger or hide content when pointer hover is applied or removed, if pointer hover is supported at all. In fact, many closed functionality products do not include a pointing device or touchscreen, so hover may not even be possible. Therefore, there is no need to impose this requirement on all closed functionality software.</li>
<li><a href="#keyboard">2.1.1 Keyboard</a>—Requires operation via a keyboard interface which allows alternative input devices. There is no need to impose this requirement on all closed functionality software.  Many closed functionality products do not have a keyboard or have a partial keyboard, such as a numeric keypad. Functions are often available using tactilely discernable buttons or fulfill this requirement through alternate means that are covered by specific requirements intended for closed functionality products.</li>
<li><a href="#bypass-blocks">2.4.1 Bypass Blocks</a>—The WCAG2ICT interpretation of this SC replaces "sets of Web pages" with "set of software programs" which is extremely rare - especially for Closed functionality software. However, being able to bypass blocks of content that are repeated within software is generally considered best practice.</li>
<li><a href="#page-titled">2.4.2 Page Titled</a>—Where software is an integral part of hardware that provides a single function, such as a calculator or IP telephone, there is no need for a title. In addition, a software program does not equate to a "page" or "screen" of content that is a step in a process. Closed functionality products often break processes down to a series of screens, each with a single function. Requiring a page title for each would be distracting and take the user more time to take action and complete transactions.</li>
<li><a href="#multiple-ways">2.4.5 Multiple Ways</a>—The WCAG2ICT interpretation of this SC replaces "sets of Web pages" with "set of software programs" which is extremely rare - especially for closed functionality software. There are a number of notes in the section <a href="#guidance-when-applying-success-criterion-2-4-5-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Guidance When Applying Success Criterion 2.4.5 to Non-Web Documents and Software</a> that are applicable to closed functionality software.</li>
<li><a href="#pointer-cancellation">2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation</a>—There are cases in closed functionality software where there are essential features that would meet the exception to this success criterion. Examples include features for meeting environmental energy usage requirements (like waking a device from sleep, power saver mode, and low power state).</li>
<li><a href="#label-in-name">2.5.3 Label in Name</a>—Requires information in a programmatically determinable form; specifically, the programmatic name contains the text of the visual label.</li>
<li><a href="#language-of-page">3.1.1 Language of Page</a>—Requires language information in a programmatically determinable form intended to drive correct pronunciation. Self-voicing is already required for closed functionality software to support, with the correct pronunciation of language(s) supported by the software.</li>
<li><a href="#language-of-parts">3.1.2 Language of Parts</a>—Requires information in a programmatically determinable form. Support for correct pronunciation of other languages embedded in other content would require alternate means to produce correct pronunciation and can be difficult for closed functionality software to support.</li>
<li><a href="#consistent-navigation">3.2.3 Consistent Navigation</a>—This Success Criterion is interpreted to only apply to "sets of software programs" which is very rare. See the second note in the section <a href="#guidance-when-applying-success-criterion-3-2-3-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Guidance When Applying Success Criterion 3.2.3 to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#consistent-identification">3.2.4 Consistent Identification</a>—This SC is interpreted to only apply to "sets of software programs" which is very rare. See the second note in the section <a href="#guidance-when-applying-success-criterion-3-2-4-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Guidance When Applying Success Criterion 3.2.4 Consistent Identification to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#error-identification">3.3.1 Error Identification</a>—While it's important for errors that can be detected to be described to the user, for closed functionality, the error description doesn't have to be provided in text, as defined in WCAG 2.2.</li>
<li><a href="#parsing">4.1.1 Parsing</a>—The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/parsing.html#intent">Intent of 4.1.1</a> is to provide consistency in markup implementation so that different user agents or assistive technologies will yield the same result.</li>
<div class="note">Success Criterion 4.1.1 has been made obsolete and removed in WCAG 2.2.</div>
<li><a href="#name-role-value">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>—Requires information in a programmatically determinable form. Some other mechanism would be needed to contextually reveal needed information to the user. </li>
<li><a href="#status-messages">4.1.3 Status Messages</a>—Requires information in a programmatic determinable form. Additionally, software with closed functionality is not typically implemented using markup languages.</li>
<div class="note">Non-web software with closed functionality would need equivalent facilitation to provide access to status messages.</div></li>
</ul>
