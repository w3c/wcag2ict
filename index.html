			<p>This document provides informative guidance (guidance that is not normative, and that does not set requirements) with regard to the interpretation and application of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2</a> [<cite><a href="http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#REF-WCAG22">WCAG22</a></cite>] to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT). This document is a proposed update to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr#WGNote">2013 WCAG2ICT Working Group Note</a> (in contrast to WCAG 2.2, which is a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Candidate Recommendation). Specifically, this document provides informative guidance on applying WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA success criteria to non-web ICT, specifically to non-web documents and software.</p>
			<p>This document is intended to help clarify how to use WCAG 2.2 to make non-web documents and software more accessible to people with disabilities. Addressing accessibility involves addressing the needs of people with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities, and the needs of people with accessibility requirements due to the effects of aging. Although this document covers a wide range of issues, it is not able to address all the needs of all people with disabilities. Because WCAG 2.2 was developed for the Web, addressing accessibility for non-web documents and software may involve provisions beyond those included in this document. Authors and developers are encouraged to seek relevant advice about current best practices to ensure that non-web documents and software are accessible, as far as possible, to people with disabilities.</p>
			<p>While WCAG 2.2 was designed to be technology-neutral, it assumes the presence of a “user agent” such as a browser, media player, or assistive technology as a means to access web content. Therefore, the application of WCAG 2.2 to documents and software in non-web contexts required some interpretation in order to determine how the intent of each WCAG 2.2 success criterion could be met in these different contexts of use. The bulk of the Task Force's work therefore involved evaluating how each WCAG 2.2 success criterion would apply in the context of non-web ICT, if it were applied to non-web ICT.</p>
			<p>The Task Force found that the majority of success criteria from WCAG 2.2 can apply to non-web documents and software with no or only minimal changes. Specifically, of the thirty-eight Level A and AA success criteria, twenty-six did not include any web related terms and apply directly as written and as described in the “Intent” sections from the updated <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/">Understanding WCAG 2.2</a> [<cite><a href="http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#REF-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG22">UNDERSTANDING-WCAG22</a></cite>]. Thirteen of these twenty-six applied without any additional notes. The other thirteen applied as written but additional notes were also provided for assistance in applying them to either or both non-web documents and software. </p>
			<p>Of the remaining twelve success criteria, the Task Force found that eight of them apply as written when replacing certain Web-specific terms or phrases like “web page(s)” with non-web terms or phrases like “non-web document(s) and software” or “for non-web documents and software that use markup languages, in such a way that…” etc. Additional notes were also provided to assist in the application of these. </p>
			<p>The remaining four success criteria apply in situations when “a set of web pages”, or “multiple web pages” share some characteristic or behavior. In WCAG 2.2 the “unit of conformance” is the web page. While WCAG2ICT is not a standard, and thus conformance does not apply, it is still useful to look at what a “unit of evaluation” would be for non-web ICT. For non-web documents, WCAG2ICT uses a single document as the “unit of evaluation”, as it is the best analog to a web page. This became the basis for the notion of a “<a href="http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-documents">set of documents</a>”, which is used for the remaining four success criteria which in WCAG speak to “sets of web pages”. For non-web software it wasn't possible to unambiguously carve up software into discrete pieces, and so the “unit of evaluation” for non-web software is the software program. This became the basis for the notion of a “<a href="http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_set-of-software-programs">set of software programs</a>”, which is used for the remaining four success criteria.</p>
			<p>The 83 glossary terms were also reviewed. 51 applied to non-Web documents and software as written. Another 28 applied with additional notes or edits (largely related to phrases like “Web page(s)”), and the remaining 4 terms were only used in Level AAA success criteria which are not addressed by this Note.</p>

				<p>The following are out of scope for this document:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>This document does not seek to determine which WCAG 2.2 provisions (principles, guidelines, or success criteria) should or should not apply to non-web ICT, but rather how they would apply, if applied.</li>
					<li>This document does not propose changes to WCAG 2.2 itself, nor its supporting documents; and does not include interpretations for implementing WCAG 2.2 in web technologies. During the development of this document, the WCAG2ICT Task Force did seek clarification on the intent of a number of the success criteria, which led to clarifications that are being made to the Understanding WCAG 2.2 document. </li>
					<li>Because this document deals with applying WCAG, which is a standard for web content accessibility, to ICT it does not deal with such things as closed products and requirements for non-user interface aspects of platforms, nor individual components. As such, this document is not sufficient by itself to ensure accessibility in non-web documents and software.</li>
					<li>This document does not comment on hardware aspects of products, non-user interface aspects of platforms, or user-interface components as individual items, because the basic constructs on which WCAG 2.2 is built do not apply to these. </li>
					<li>This document does not provide supporting techniques for implementing WCAG 2.2 in non-web documents and software.</li>
					<li>As this document is purely an informative Note about non-web ICT, and not a standard, it doesn't describe how non-web ICT should conform to it.</li>

			<p>Of the 83 glossary terms used in WCAG 2.2 there are two key glossary terms that need to be interpreted significantly differently when applied to non-web ICT. These are: “content” and “user agent”. Further, the glossary term “Web page” in WCAG 2.2 is replaced with newly defined terms “document” and “software”, and both “set of web pages” and “multiple web pages” are replaced with the newly defined terms “set of documents” and “set of software programs”. Finally, as part of addressing the fact that non-Web software doesn't leverage the WCAG 2.2 notion of a user agent, we introduce the new term “accessibility services of platform software”. The remaining 79 glossary terms from WCAG 2.2 are addressed in <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#comments-on-definitions-in-wcag-2-0-glossary-in-appendix-a">Chapter 7 Comments on Definitions in WCAG 2.2 Glossary in Appendix A</a>. Terms defined and used in WCAG2ICT are applicable only to the interpretation of the guidance in this document. The particular definitions should not be interpreted as having applicability to situations beyond the scope of WCAG2ICT. Further information on usage of these terms follows.</p>

				<p>WCAG 2.2 defines CONTENT as:</p>

				<p>For non-web content it is necessary to view this a bit more broadly. Within WCAG2ICT, the term “content” is used as follows: </p>

				<p>For non-web ICT, “user agent” needs to be viewed differently. In WCAG 2.2, the term “user agent” only refers to retrieval and display of web content.

			<p>As noted in the Introduction, WCAG 2.2 assumes the presence of a “user agent” such as a browser, media player, or assistive technology as a means to access web content. Furthermore, many of the success criteria in WCAG 2.2 assume web content will be accessed by ICT that has assistive technologies connected to it, where the assistive technologies present the web content to the people with disabilities in accessible form. ICT products with “closed functionality” do not allow the use of some assistive technologies for all of their functions. In many cases such ICT products also lack a “user agent” or their equivalent. As a result, ICT following these success criteria by themselves will not make information accessible on ICT with closed functionality. Something else needs to be provided or be required in order to make the information addressed in these success criteria accessible. It is outside the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/wcag2ict/work-statement">WCAG2ICT Task Force Work Statement</a> to say what the additional measures are, but this Note points out which success criteria depend on assistive technologies—and therefore would not work by themselves in products with closed functionality. </p>
			<p>Because closed functionality, by definition, does not allow a user to attach assistive technology, WCAG success criteria that assume the presence of assistive technology will not facilitate accessibility as WCAG 2.2 intends. Where assistive technologies cannot be used, other output and input solutions are needed to achieve the intent of these success criteria.</p>
			<p>Examples of products with closed functionality include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>an ebook or ebook reader program that allows assistive technologies to access all of the user interface controls of the ebook program (open functionality) but does not allow the assistive technologies to access the actual content of book (closed functionality).</li>
				<li>an operating system that requires the user to provide log in credentials before it allows any assistive technologies to be loaded. The log-in portion would be closed functionality. </li>
				<li>a travel kiosk that provides an audio interface for blind and vision-impaired users as a built-in alternative to the visual interface and tactile keys as an alternative to touch screen operation for both blind users and those who can't operate a touch screen.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>See <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#success-criteria-problematic-for-closed-functionality">Appendix A: Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality</a> for a list of success criteria for which this is relevant.</p>

			<p>Text applications are a class of software ICT that appeared decades ago, prior to the emergence of the graphical user interface (GUI) and the Web. The interface of a text application is generated using only text characters, and either a hardware terminal or a software terminal application handles the rendering of the text application—similar to how a web user agent handles the rendering of a web application. Text applications only accept text input (though some terminal applications which render text applications in the GUI may utilize a mouse or other input devices). Command-line applications are a subset of text applications with further specific properties.</p>
			<p>Historically, assistive technologies developed alongside text applications, and several of these use a variety of analysis and scripting techniques to make text applications accessible. Although there are far fewer new text applications being developed compared to new GUI or web applications, text applications remain in use today, and both text applications and the assistive technologies designed for text applications are in active development.</p>
			<p>Though this class of applications predates the Web, WCAG can be applied to them. As noted in <a href="http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#background-on-text-command-line-terminal-applications-and-interfaces">Appendix B. Background on Text / Command-line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces</a>, applying WCAG to text / command-line applications involves understanding how text applications are rendered, how text applications have been made accessible via assistive technologies, and how to apply the concepts of “accessibility supported” and “programmatically determined” to text applications.</p>

			<p>WCAG2ICT is not a standard, so it is not possible to conform to WCAG2ICT. However, some entities may wish to use the information in WCAG2ICT to help establish standards or regulations regarding accessibility in ICT that are based on WCAG 2.2. While such standards or regulations will need to address matters of conformance themselves, the following notes may be of assistance to those wishing to draft their own requirements:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The WCAG 2.2 success criteria and the conformance requirements were designed to work together, such that the language of the success criteria is based on the nature of the conformance requirements. The choice of what level to use for a given criteria (A vs. AA vs. AAA) was further influenced by a number of factors specific to the web domain, as set forth in <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#levels">Understanding Levels of Conformance</a>.</li>
				<li>In the WCAG 2.2 conformance model, a success criteria is satisfied if the item being evaluated does not fail it. If the success criterion is in relation to something that does not exist for the item being evaluated (e.g. a success criterion is about captioning audio and there is no audio) then the success criterion is automatically met. This approach is central to the way the success criteria in WCAG are structured and worded.</li>
				<li>WCAG 2.2 conformance is applied to the item being evaluated (i.e. web page) as a whole, except when a process includes use of several items, in which case all of the items that are needed in order to complete the process must conform.</li>
				<li>In WCAG 2.2, when conformance relies on accessibility features of the platform (i.e. browser for web content) or on assistive technologies, WCAG 2.2 requires that there are assistive technologies, etc. that work with the product (web page). That is, conformance with WCAG 2.2 requires that the approaches used are supported by assistive technologies.</li>
				<li>WCAG 2.2 allows information on part of a page to not conform if the same information is available elsewhere on the page in conforming fashion. However WCAG 2.2 identifies 4 success criteria that must be met on all areas of the page because they can interfere with the user's ability to access and use other parts of the page:<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-control">1.4.2 Audio Control</a>;</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#no-keyboard-trap">2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap</a>;</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#pause-stop-hide">2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide</a>.</li>
						<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#three-flashes-or-below-threshold">2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold</a>;</li>
					</ul></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Also, as noted in the Introduction, it wasn't possible to unambiguously carve up software into discrete pieces, and so the unit of evaluation for non-web software is the whole software program. As with any software testing this can be a very large unit of evaluation, and methods similar to standard software testing might be used.</p>

								<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content#intent" class="sc intent">
									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by non-text content accessible through the use of a text alternative. Text alternatives are a primary way for making information accessible because they can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech. A person who cannot hear an audio file can have the text alternative displayed so that he or she can read it. In the future, text alternatives will also allow information to be more easily translated into sign language or into a simpler form of the same language.</p>
									<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-25"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-25" aria-level="7"><span>Note</span><span class="issue-label">: Note on CAPTCHA</span></div><p class=""><abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHAs</abbr> are a controversial topic in the accessibility community. As is described in the paper <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a>, <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHAs</abbr> intrinsically push the edges of human abilities in an attempt to defeat automated processes. Every type of CAPTCHA will be unsolvable by users with certain disabilities. However, they are widely used, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group believes that if <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHAs</abbr> were forbidden outright, Web sites would choose not to conform to WCAG rather than abandon CAPTCHA. This would create barriers for a great many more users with disabilities. For this reason the Working Group has chosen to structure the requirement about CAPTCHA in a way that meets the needs of most people with disabilities, yet is also considered adoptable by sites. Requiring two different forms of CAPTCHA on a given site ensures that most people with disabilities will find a form they can use.</p></div>
									<p>Because some users with disabilities will still not be able to access sites that meet the minimum requirements, the Working Group provides recommendations for additional steps. Organizations motivated to conform to WCAG should be aware of the importance of this topic and should go as far beyond the minimum requirements of the guidelines as possible. Additional recommended steps include:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>Providing more than two modalities of <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHAs</abbr></p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Providing access to a human customer service representative who can bypass CAPTCHA</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Not requiring <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHAs</abbr> for authorized users</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<div class="header-wrapper"><h6 id="additional-information">Additional information</h6><a class="self-link" href="#additional-information" aria-label="Permalink for this Section"></a></div>
									<p>Non-text content can take a number of forms, and this Success Criterion specifies how each is to be handled.</p>
									<p><strong> For non-text content that is not covered by one of the other situations listed below,</strong> such as charts, diagrams, audio recordings, pictures, and animations, text alternatives can make the same information available in a form that can be rendered through any modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile). Short and long text alternatives can be used as needed to convey the information in the non-text content. Note that <strong> prerecorded audio-only</strong> and <strong> prerecorded video-only</strong> files are covered here. <strong> Live-audio-only</strong> and <strong> Live-video-only</strong> files are covered below (see 3rd paragraph following this one). </p>
									<p><strong> For non-text content that is a control or accepts user input</strong>, such as images used as submit buttons, image maps or complex animations, a name is provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content so that the person at least knows what the non-text content is and why it is there.</p>
									<p><strong> Non-text content that is time-based media</strong> is made accessible through <em><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/time-based-media">1.2</a></em>. However, it is important that users know what it is when they encounter it on a page so they can decide what action if any they want to take with it. A text alternative that describes the time-based media and/or gives its title is therefore provided. </p>
									<p><strong> For Live Audio-only and live video-only content</strong>, it can be much more difficult to provide text alternatives that provide equivalent information as live audio-only and live video-only content. For these types of non-text content, text alternatives provide a descriptive label. </p>
									<p><strong> Sometimes a test or exercise must be partially or completely presented in non-text format.</strong> Audio or visual information is provided that cannot be changed to text because the test or exercise must be conducted using that sense. For example, a hearing test would be invalid if a text alternative were provided. A visual skill development exercise would similarly make no sense in text form. And a spelling test with text alternatives would not be very effective. For these cases, text alternatives should be provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content; of course, the text alternatives would not provide the same information needed to pass the test. </p>
									<p><strong> Sometimes content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience</strong> that words cannot fully capture. Examples include a symphony performance, works of visual art etc. For such content, text alternatives at least identify the non-text content with a descriptive label and where possible, additional descriptive text. If the reason for including the content in the page is known and can be described it is helpful to include that information. </p>
									<p><strong>Sometimes there are non-text exercises that are used to prove you are human.</strong> To avoid spam robots and other software from gaining access to a site a device called a CAPTCHA is used. These usually involve visual or auditory tasks that are beyond the current capabilities of Web robots. Providing a text alternative to them would however make them operable by Robots, thus defeating their purpose. In this case a text alternative would describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA, and alternate forms using different modalities would be provided to address the needs of people with different disabilities.</p>
									<p><strong> Sometimes there is non-text content that really is not meant to be seen or understood by the user.</strong> Transparent images used to move text over on a page; an invisible image that is used to track usage statistics; and a swirl in the corner that conveys no information but just fills up a blank space to create an aesthetic effect are all examples of this. Putting alternative text on such items just distracts people using screen readers from the content on the page. Not marking the content in any way, though, leaves users guessing what the non-text content is and what information they may have missed (even though they have not missed anything in reality). This type of non-text content, therefore, is marked or implemented in a way that assistive technologies (AT) will ignore it and not present anything to the user.</p>

									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>This Success Criterion helps people who have difficulty perceiving visual content. Assistive technology can read text aloud, present it visually, or convert it to braille.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Text alternatives may help some people who have difficulty understanding the meaning of photographs, drawings, and other images (e.g., line drawings, graphic designs, paintings, three-dimensional representations), graphs, charts, animations, etc. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p> People who are deaf, are hard of hearing, or who are having trouble understanding audio information for any reason can read the text presentation. Research is ongoing regarding automatic translation of text into sign language. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p> People who are deaf-blind can read the text in braille. </p>

						<p>In WCAG 2.2, the Guidelines are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not required for conformance to WCAG. Guideline 1.2 applies directly as written.</p>
						<details>
							<summary>Intent from <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/time-based-media#intent">Understanding Guideline 1.2 in Understanding 2.2</a>:</summary>
							<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/time-based-media#intent" class="gl intent">
								<p>The purpose of this guideline is to provide access to time-based and synchronized media.This includes media that is:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>audio-only</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>video-only </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>audio-video </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>audio and/or video combined with interaction </p>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>To make it easy for authors to quickly determine which success criteria apply to their content, the type of media each success criterion applies to is included in its short name. </p>
								<p>For <strong>audio-only</strong> or <strong>video-only</strong> media, you only need to apply the success criteria that say "<strong>audio-only</strong>" or "<strong>video-only</strong>" in their short name. If your media is not <strong>audio-only</strong> or <strong>video-only</strong>, then all the rest of the success criteria apply.</p>
								<p>Media can also be <strong>live</strong> or <strong>prerecorded</strong>. Each of the success criterion short names clearly tells you if the success criterion applies to <strong>live</strong> or <strong>prerecorded</strong> media. </p>
								<p><b>Synchronized media</b> is defined in the glossary as:</p>
								<dl>
									<dt class="label">synchronized media</dt>
									<dd>
										<p><a class="termref" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-audio">audio</a> or <a class="termref" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-video">video</a> synchronized with another format for presenting information and/or with time-based interactive components, unless the media is a <a class="termref" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-media-alternative-for-text">media alternative for text</a> that is clearly labeled as such </p>
									</dd>
								</dl>
								<p>Note that an audio file accompanied by interaction is covered here, as is a video-only file that involves interaction. These are covered because interaction must take place at a particular time. Having a text transcript that said, "for more information, click now," would not be very helpful since the reader would have no idea when the audio said, "now." As a result, synchronized captions would be needed.</p>
								<p>Sometimes, there is so much dialogue that audio description cannot fit into existing pauses in the dialogue. The option at Level A to provide an alternative for time-based media instead of audio description for synchronized media would allow access to all of the information in the synchronized media. This option also allows access to the visual information in non-visual form when audio description is not provided for some other reason.</p>
								<p>For synchronized media that includes interaction, interactive elements (for example links) could be embedded in the alternative for time-based media.</p>
								<p>This guideline also includes (at Level AAA) sign language interpretation for synchronized media as well as an approach called extended audio description. In extended audio description, the video is frozen periodically to allow more audio description to take place than is possible in the existing pauses in the dialogue. This is a case where higher-level Success Criteria build upon the requirements of lower-level Success Criterion with the intention of having cumulative, progressively stronger, requirements.</p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who are deaf or hard of hearing to watch synchronized media presentations. Captions provide the part of the content available via the audio track. Captions not only include dialogue, but identify who is speaking and include non-speech information conveyed through sound, including meaningful sound effects. </p>
									<p>It is acknowledged that at the present time there may be difficulty in creating captions for time-sensitive material and this may result in the author being faced with the choice of delaying the information until captions are available, or publishing time-sensitive content that is inaccessible to the deaf, at least for the interval until captions are available. Over time, the tools for captioning as well as building the captioning into the delivery process can shorten or eliminate such delays. </p>
									<p>Captions are not needed when the synchronized media is, itself, an alternate presentation of information that is also presented via text on the Web page. For example, if information on a page is accompanied by a synchronized media presentation that presents no more information than is already presented in text, but is easier for people with cognitive, language, or learning disabilities to understand, then it would not need to be captioned since the information is already presented on the page in text or in text alternatives (e.g., for images). </p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide people who are blind or visually impaired access to the visual information in a synchronized media presentation. This Success Criterion describes two approaches, either of which can be used.</p>
									<p>One approach is to provide audio description of the video content. The audio description augments the audio portion of the presentation with the information needed when the video portion is not available. During existing pauses in dialogue, audio description provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, and on-screen text that are important and are not described or spoken in the main sound track.</p>
									<p>The second approach involves providing all of the information in the synchronized media (both visual and auditory) in text form. An alternative for time-based media provides a running description of all that is going on in the synchronized media content. The alternative for time-based media reads something like a screenplay or book. Unlike audio description, the description of the video portion is not constrained to just the pauses in the existing dialogue. Full descriptions are provided of all visual information, including visual context, actions and expressions of actors, and any other visual material. In addition, non-speech sounds (laughter, off-screen voices, etc.) are described, and transcripts of all dialogue are included. The sequence of description and dialogue transcripts are the same as the sequence in the synchronized media itself. As a result, the alternative for time-based media can provide a much more complete representation of the synchronized media
										content than audio description alone.</p>
									<p>If there is any interaction as part of the synchronized media presentation (e.g., "press now to answer the question") then the alternative for time-based media would provide hyperlinks or whatever is needed to provide the same functionality.</p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note 1: </em> For 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7, if all of the information in the video track is already provided in the audio track, no audio description is necessary. </p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note 2: </em> 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8 overlap somewhat with each other. This is to give the author some choice at the minimum conformance level, and to provide additional requirements at higher levels. At Level A in Success Criterion 1.2.3, authors do have the choice of providing either an audio description or a full text alternative. If they wish to conform at Level AA, under Success Criterion 1.2.5 authors must provide an audio description - a requirement already met if they chose that alternative for 1.2.3, otherwise an additional requirement. At Level AAA under Success Criterion 1.2.8 they must provide an extended text description. This is an additional requirement if both 1.2.3 and 1.2.5 were met by providing an audio description only. If 1.2.3 was met, however, by providing a text description, and the 1.2.5 requirement for an audio description was met, then 1.2.8 does not add new requirements.</p>

								<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships#intent" class="sc intent">
									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that information and relationships that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are preserved when the presentation format changes. For example, the presentation format changes when the content is read by a screen reader or when a user style sheet is substituted for the style sheet provided by the author.</p>
									<p> Sighted users perceive structure and relationships through various visual cues — headings are often in a larger, bold font separated from paragraphs by blank lines; list items are preceded by a bullet and perhaps indented; paragraphs are separated by a blank line; items that share a common characteristic are organized into tabular rows and columns; form fields may be positioned as groups that share text labels; a different background color may be used to indicate that several items are related to each other; words that have special status are indicated by changing the font family and /or bolding, italicizing, or underlining them; items that share a common characteristic are organized into a table where the relationship of cells sharing the same row or column and the relationship of each cell to its row and/or column header are necessary for understanding; and so on. Having these structures and these relationships programmatically determined or available in text ensures that information important for comprehension will be perceivable to all. </p>
									<p>Auditory cues may be used as well. For example, a chime might indicate the beginning of a new section; a change in voice pitch or speech rate may be used to emphasize important information or to indicate quoted text; etc.</p>
									<p> When such relationships are perceivable to one set of users, those relationships can be made to be perceivable to all. One method of determining whether or not information has been properly provided to all users is to access the information serially in different modalities. </p>
									<p>If links to glossary items are implemented using anchor elements (or the proper link element for the technology in use) and identified using a different font face, a screen reader user will hear that the item is a link when the glossary term is encountered even though they may not receive information about the change in font face. An on-line catalog may indicate prices using a larger font colored red. A screen reader or person who cannot perceive red, still has the information about the price as long as it is preceded by the currency symbol.</p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable a user agent to provide an alternative presentation of content while preserving the reading order needed to understand the meaning. It is important that it be possible to programmatically determine at least one sequence of the content that makes sense. Content that does not meet this Success Criterion may confuse or disorient users when assistive technology reads the content in the wrong order, or when alternate style sheets or other formatting changes are applied. </p>
									<p>A sequence is <em>meaningful</em> if the order of content in the sequence cannot be changed without affecting its meaning. For example, if a page contains two independent articles, the relative order of the articles may not affect their meaning, as long as they are not interleaved. In such a situation, the articles themselves may have meaningful sequence, but the container that contains the articles may not have a meaningful sequence.</p>
									<p>The semantics of some elements define whether or not their content is a meaningful sequence. For instance, in HTML, text is always a meaningful sequence. Tables and ordered lists are meaningful sequences, but unordered lists are not.</p>
									<p>The order of content in a sequence is not always meaningful. For example, the relative order of the main section of a Web page and a navigation section does not affect their meaning. They could occur in either order in the programmatically determined reading sequence. As another example, a magazine article contains several callout sidebars. The order of the article and the sidebars does not affect their meaning. In these cases there are a number of different reading orders for a Web page that can satisfy the Success Criterion. </p>
									<p>For clarity:</p>
									<ol class="enumar">
										<li>
											<p>Providing a particular linear order is only required where it affects meaning.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>There may be more than one order that is "correct" (according to the WCAG 2.2 definition).</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Only one correct order needs to be provided.</p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access instructions for using the content, even when they cannot perceive shape or size or use information about spatial location or orientation. Some content relies on knowledge of the shape or position of objects that are not available from the structure of the content (for example, "round button" or "button to the right"). Some users with disabilities are not able to perceive shape or position due to the nature of the assistive technologies they use. This Success Criterion requires that additional information be provided to clarify anything that is dependent on this kind of information. </p>
									<p>Providing information using shape and/or location, however, is an effective method for many users including those with cognitive limitations. This provision should not discourage those types of cues as long as the information is also provided in other ways. </p>
									<p>In some languages, it is commonly understood that "above" refers to the content previous to that point in the content and "below" refers to the content after that point. In such languages, if the content being referenced is in the appropriate place in the reading order and the references are unambiguous, statements such as "choose one of the links below" or "all of the above" would conform to this Success Criterion. </p>
									<p>WCAG was designed to apply only to controls that were displayed on a web page. The intent was to avoid describing controls solely via references to visual or auditory cues. When applying this to instructions for operating physical hardware controls (e.g. a web kiosk with dedicated content), tactile cues on the hardware might be described (e.g. the arrow shaped key, the round key on the right side). This success criterion is not intended to prevent the use of tactile cues in instructions.</p>

							<p>This applies directly as written, and as described in <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum#intent">Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3</a> (also provided below).</p>
							<details>
								<summary>Intent from <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum#intent">Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3 in Understanding WCAG 2.2</a>:</summary>
								<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum#intent" class="sc intent">
									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and its background so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision (who do not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). For people without color deficiencies, hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading performance (Knoblauch et al., 1991). Color deficiencies can affect luminance contrast somewhat. Therefore, in the recommendation, the contrast is calculated in such a way that color is not a key factor so that people who have a color vision deficit will also have adequate contrast between the text and the background.</p>
									<p>Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded. For example, if random words are used to create a background and the words could be rearranged or substituted without changing meaning, then it would be decorative and would not need to meet this criterion. </p>
									<p>Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast. The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower. This allows authors to use a wider range of color choices for large text, which is helpful for design of pages, particularly titles. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large enough to require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress Guidelines for Large Print under <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum#resources">Related Resources</a>). "18 point" and "bold" can both have different meanings in different fonts but, except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since there are so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a note regarding fancy or thin fonts is included.</p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note: </em>Because different image editing applications default to different pixel densities (<abbr title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 72 PPI or 96 PPI), specifying point sizes for fonts from within an image editing application can be unreliable when it comes to presenting text at a specific size. When creating images of large-scale text, authors should ensure that the text in the resulting image is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the default size for body text. For example, for a 72 PPI image, an author would need to use approximately 19 pt and 24 pt font sizes in order to successfully present images of large-scale text to a user. </p>
									<p>The previously-mentioned contrast requirements for text also apply to images of text (text that has been rendered into pixels and then stored in an image format) as stated in Success Criterion 1.4.3. </p>
									<p>This requirement applies to situations in which images of text were intended to be understood as text. Incidental text, such as in photographs that happen to include a street sign, are not included. Nor is text that for some reason is designed to be invisible to all viewers. Stylized text, such as in corporate logos, should be treated in terms of its function on the page, which may or may not warrant including the content in the text alternative. Corporate visual guidelines beyond logo and logotype are not included in the exception. </p>
									<p>In this provision there is an exception that reads "that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content,". This exception is intended to separate pictures that have text in them from images of text that are done to replace text in order to get a particular look. </p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note 1: </em>Some people with cognitive disabilities require color combinations or hues that have low contrast, and therefore we allow and encourage authors to provide mechanisms to adjust the foreground and background colors of the content. Some of the combinations that could be chosen may have contrast levels that will be lower than those found in the Success Criteria. This is not a violation of this Success Criteria provided there is a mechanism that will return to the default values set out in the Success Criteria. </p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note 2: </em>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate. It is also harder to change foreground and background contrast and color combinations for images of text, which is necessary for some users. Therefore, we suggest using text wherever possible, and when not, consider supplying an image of higher resolution. </p>
									<p>Although this Success Criterion only applies to text, similar issues occur for data presented in charts or graphs. Good color contrast should also be provided for data presented in these forms. </p>

									<p>A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20130905/appendixD.html#ISO-9241-3">[ISO-9241-3]</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20130905/appendixD.html#ANSI-HFES-100-1988">[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]</a> for standard text and vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in this provision to account for the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity, congenital or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast sensitivity that typically accompanies aging.</p>
									<p>The rationale is based on a) adoption of the 3:1 contrast ratio for minimum acceptable contrast for normal observers, in the ANSI standard, and b) the empirical finding that in the population, visual acuity of 20/40 is associated with a contrast sensitivity loss of roughly 1.5 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20130905/appendixD.html#ARDITI-FAYE">[ARDITI-FAYE]</a>. A user with 20/40 would thus require a contrast ratio of 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 to 1. Following analogous empirical findings and the same logic, the user with 20/80 visual acuity would require contrast of about 7:1.</p>
									<p>Hues are perceived differently by users with color vision deficiencies (both congenital and acquired) resulting in different colors and relative luminance contrasts than for normally sighted users. Because of this, effective contrast and readability are different for this population. However, color deficiencies are so diverse that prescribing effective general use color pairs (for contrast) based on quantitative data is not feasible. Requiring good luminance contrast accommodates this by requiring contrast that is independent of color perception. Fortunately, most of the luminance contribution is from the mid and long wave receptors which largely overlap in their spectral responses. The result is that effective luminance contrast can generally be computed without regard to specific color deficiency, except for the use of predominantly long wavelength colors against darker colors (generally appearing black) for those who have protanopia. (We provide an advisory
										technique on avoiding red on black for that reason). For more information see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20130905/appendixD.html#ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1994">[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH]</a>

									<p>The contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was chosen for level AA because it compensated for the loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/40 vision. (20/40 calculates to approximately 4.5:1.) 20/40 is commonly reported as typical visual acuity of elders at roughly age 80. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20130905/appendixD.html#GITTINGS-FOZARD">[GITTINGS-FOZARD]</a></p>
									<p>The contrast ratio of 7:1 was chosen for level AAA because it compensated for the loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent to approximately 20/80 vision. People with more than this degree of vision loss usually use assistive technologies to access their content (and the assistive technologies usually have contrast enhancing, as well as magnification capability built into them). The 7:1 level therefore generally provides compensation for the loss in contrast sensitivity experienced by users with low vision who do not use assistive technology and provides contrast enhancement for color deficiency as well.</p>

											<p>People with low vision often have difficulty reading text that does not contrast with its background. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that lowers the contrast even further. Providing a minimum luminance contrast ratio between the text and its background can make the text more readable even if the person does not see the full range of colors. It also works for the rare individuals who see no color. </p>

								<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text#intent" class="sc intent">
									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that visually rendered text, including text-based controls (text characters that have been displayed so that they can be seen [vs. text characters that are still in data form such as ASCII]) can be scaled successfully so that it can be read directly by people with mild visual disabilities, without requiring the use of assistive technology such as a screen magnifier. Users may benefit from scaling all content on the Web page, but text is most critical. </p>
									<p>The scaling of content is primarily a user agent responsibility. User agents that satisfy <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/guidelines.html#tech-configure-text-scale">UAAG 1.0 Checkpoint 4.1</a> allow users to configure text scale. The author's responsibility is to create Web content that does not prevent the user agent from scaling the content effectively. Authors may satisfy this Success Criterion by verifying that content does not interfere with user agent support for resizing text, including text-based controls, or by providing direct support for resizing text or changing the layout. An example of direct support might be via server-side script that can be used to assign different style sheets.</p>
									<p>The author cannot rely on the user agent to satisfy this Success Criterion for HTML content if users do not have access to a user agent with zoom support. For example, if they work in an environment that requires them to use IE 6.</p>
									<p>If the author is using a technology whose user agents do not provide zoom support, the author is responsible to provide this type of functionality directly or to provide content that works with the type of functionality provided by the user agent. If the user agent doesn't provide zoom functionality but does let the the user change the text size, the author is responsible for ensuring that the content remains usable when the text is resized. </p>
									<p>Some user interface components that function as a label and require activation by the user to access content are not wide enough to accommodate the label's content. For example, in Web mail applications the subject column may not be wide enough to accommodate every possible subject header, but activating the subject header takes the user to the full message with the full subject header. In Web-based spreadsheets, cell content that is too long to be displayed in a column can be truncated, and the full content of the cell is available to the user when the cell receives focus. The content of a user interface component may also become too wide in user interfaces where the user can resize the column width. In this type of user interface component, line wrapping is not required; truncation is acceptable if the component's full content is available on focus or after user activation and an indication that this information can be accessed, is provided to the user in some
										way besides the fact that it is truncated.</p>
									<p>Content satisfies the Success Criterion if it can be scaled up to 200%, that is, up to twice the width and height. Authors may support scaling beyond that limit, however, as scaling becomes more extreme, adaptive layouts may introduce usability problems. For example, words may be too wide to fit into the horizontal space available to them, causing them to be truncated; layout constraints may cause text to overlap with other content when it is scaled larger; or only one word of a sentence may fit on each line, causing the sentence to be displayed as a vertical column of text that is difficult to read. </p>
									<p>The working group feels that 200% is a reasonable accommodation that can support a wide range of designs and layouts, and complements older screen magnifiers that provide a minimum magnification of 200%. Above 200%, zoom (which resizes text, images, and layout regions and creates a larger canvas that may require both horizontal and vertical scrolling) may be more effective than text resizing. Assistive technology dedicated to zoom support would usually be used in such a situation and may provide better accessibility than attempts by the author to support the user directly.</p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note: </em>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate, and therefore we suggest using text wherever possible. It is also harder to change foreground and background contrast and color combinations for images of text, which are necessary for some users. </p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage authors, who are using technologies which are capable of achieving their desired default visual presentation, to enable people who require a particular visual presentation of text to be able to adjust the text presentation as needed. This includes people who require the text in a particular font size, foreground and background color, font family, line spacing or alignment.</p>
									<p>If an author can use text to achieve the same visual effect, he or she should present the information as text rather than using an image. If for any reason, the author cannot format the text to get the same effect, the effect won't be reliably presented on the commonly available user agents, or using a technology to meet this criterion would interfere with meeting other criteria such as 1.4.4, then an image of text can be used. This includes instances where a particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed, such as type samples, logotypes, branding, etc. Images of text may also be used in order to use a particular font that is either not widely deployed or which the author doesn't have the right to redistribute, or to ensure that the text would be anti-aliased on all user agents.</p>
									<p>Images of text can also be used where it is possible for users to customize the image of text to match their requirements.</p>
									<p>The definition of image of text contains the note: "Note: This does not include text that is part of a picture that contains significant other visual content." Examples of such pictures include graphs, screenshots, and diagrams which visually convey important information through more than just text.</p>
									<p>Techniques for satisfying this Success Criterion are the same as those for Success Criterion 1.4.9, except that they only need to apply if the visual presentation can be achieved with the technologies that the author is using. For Success Criterion 1.4.9, the sufficient techniques would be applied only when the user can customize the output. </p>

								<p>If all <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-functionality">functionality</a> can be achieved using the keyboard, it can be accomplished by keyboard users, by speech input (which creates keyboard input), by mouse (using on-screen keyboards), and by a wide variety of assistive technologies that create simulated keystrokes as their output.

								<p>Note that providing universal keyboard input does not mean that other types of input should not be supported. Optimized speech input, optimized mouse/pointer input, etc., are also good. The key is to provide keyboard input and control as well.</p>
								<p>Some devices do not have native keyboards—for example, a PDA or cell phone. If these devices have a Web browsing capability, however, they will have some means of generating text or "keystrokes".

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that, wherever possible, content can be operated through a keyboard or keyboard interface (so an alternate keyboard can be used). When content can be operated through a keyboard or alternate keyboard, it is operable by people with no vision (who cannot use devices such as mice that require eye-hand coordination) as well as by people who must use alternate keyboards or input devices that act as keyboard emulators. Keyboard emulators include speech input software, sip-and-puff software, on-screen keyboards, scanning software and a variety of assistive technologies and alternate keyboards. Individuals with low vision also may have trouble tracking a pointer and find the use of software much easier (or only possible) if they can control it from the keyboard.</p>
									<p>Examples of "specific timings for individual keystrokes" include situations where a user would be required to repeat or execute multiple keystrokes within a short period of time or where a key must be held down for an extended period before the keystroke is registered. </p>
									<p>The phrase "except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints" is included to separate those things that cannot reasonably be controlled from a keyboard.</p>
									<p>Most actions carried out by a pointing device can also be done from the keyboard (for example, clicking, selecting, moving, sizing). However, there is a small class of input that is done with a pointing device that cannot be done from the keyboard in any known fashion without requiring an inordinate number of keystrokes. Free hand drawing, watercolor painting, and flying a helicopter through an obstacle course are all examples of functions that require path dependent input. Drawing straight lines, regular geometric shapes, re-sizing windows and dragging objects to a location (when the path to that location is not relevant) do not require path dependent input. </p>
									<p>The use of MouseKeys would not satisfy this Success Criterion because it is not a keyboard equivalent to the application; it is a mouse equivalent (i.e., it looks like a mouse to the application).</p>
									<p>It is assumed that the design of user input features takes into account that operating system keyboard accessibility features may be in use. For example, modifier key locking may be turned on. Content continues to function in such an environment, not sending events that would collide with the modifier key lock to produce unexpected results. </p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users with disabilities are given adequate time to interact with Web content whenever possible. People with disabilities such as blindness, low vision, dexterity impairments, and cognitive limitations may require more time to read content or to perform functions such as filling out on-line forms. If Web functions are time-dependent, it will be difficult for some users to perform the required action before a time limit occurs. This may render the service inaccessible to them. Designing functions that are not time-dependent will help people with disabilities succeed at completing these functions. Providing options to disable time limits, customize the length of time limits, or request more time before a time limit occurs helps those users who require more time than expected to successfully complete tasks. These options are listed in the order that will be most helpful for the user. Disabling time limits is better
										than customizing the length of time limits, which is better than requesting more time before a time limit occurs. </p>
									<p>Any process that happens without user initiation after a set time or on a periodic basis is a time limit. This includes partial or full updates of content (for example, page refresh), changes to content, or the expiration of a window of opportunity for a user to react to a request for input. </p>
									<p> It also includes content that is advancing or updating at a rate beyond the user's ability to read and/or understand it. In other words, animated, moving or scrolling content introduces a time limit on a users ability to read content.</p>
									<p>In some cases, however, it is not possible to change the time limit (for example, for an auction or other real-time event) and exceptions are therefore provided for those cases.</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Notes regarding server time limits</strong>
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>Timed server redirects can be found below under Common Failures.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Non-timed server redirects (e.g., 3xx response codes) are not applicable because there is no time limit: they work instantly.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>This Success Criterion applies only to time limits that are set by the content itself. For example, if a time limit is included in order to address security concerns, it would be considered to have been set by the content because it is designed to be part of the presentation and interaction experience for that content. Time limits set externally to content, such as by the user agent or by factors intrinsic to the Internet are not under the author's control and not subject to WCAG conformance requirements. Time limits set by Web servers should be under the author's/organization's control and are covered. (Success Criteria <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#no-timing">2.2.3</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#interruptions">2.2.4</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#re-authenticating">2.2.5</a> may also apply.)</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Ten times the default was chosen based on clinical experience and other guidelines. For example, if 15 seconds is allowed for a user to respond and hit a switch, 150 seconds would be sufficient to allow almost all users to hit a switch even if they had trouble. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>20 seconds was also based on clinical experience and other guidelines. 20 seconds to hit 'any switch' is sufficient for almost all users including those with spasticity. Some would fail, but some would fail all lengths of time. A reasonable period for requesting more time is required since an arbitrarily long time can provide security risks to all users, including those with disabilities, for some applications. For example, with kiosks or terminals that are used for financial transactions, it is quite common for people to walk away without signing off. This leaves them vulnerable to those walking up behind them. Providing a long period of inactivity before asking, and then providing a long period for the person to indicate that they are present can leave terminals open for abuse. If there is no activity the system should ask if the user is there. It should then ask for an indication that a person is there ('hit any key') and then wait long enough for almost
												anyone to respond. For "hit any key," 20 seconds would meet this. If the person indicates that they are still present, the device should return the user to the exact condition that existed before it asked the question. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>20 hours was chosen as an upper limit because it is longer than a full waking day. </p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>In cases where timing is not an intrinsic requirement but giving users control over timed events would invalidate the outcome, a third party can control the time limits for the user (for example, granting double time on a test). </p>

									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>People with physical disabilities often need more time to react, to type and to complete activities. People with low vision need more time to locate things on screen and to read. People who are blind and using screen readers may need more time to understand screen layouts, to find information and to operate controls. People who have cognitive or language limitations need more time to read and to understand. People who are deaf and communicate in sign language may need more time to read information printed in text (which may be a second language for some).</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In circumstances where a sign-language interpreter may be relating audio content to a user who is deaf, control over time limits is also important.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>People with reading disabilities, cognitive limitations, and learning disabilities who may need more time to read or comprehend information can have additional time to read the information by pausing the content.</p>

								<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide#intent" class="sc intent">
									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to avoid distracting users during their interaction with a Web page.</p>
									<p>"Moving, blinking and scrolling" refers to content in which the visible content conveys a sense of motion. Common examples include motion pictures, synchronized media presentations, animations, real-time games, and scrolling stock tickers. "Auto-updating" refers to content that updates or disappears based on a preset time interval. Common time-based content includes audio, automatically updated weather information, news, stock price updates, and auto-advancing presentations and messages. The requirements for moving, blinking and scrolling content and for auto-updating content are the same except that:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>authors have the option of providing the user with a means to control the frequency of updates when content is auto-updating and</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>there is no five second exception for auto-updating since it makes little sense to auto-update for just three seconds and then stop</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Content that moves or auto-updates can be a barrier to anyone who has trouble reading stationary text quickly as well as anyone who has trouble tracking moving objects. It can also cause problems for screen readers.</p>
									<p>Moving content can also be a severe distraction for some people. Certain groups, particularly those with attention deficit disorders, find blinking content distracting, making it difficult for them to concentrate on other parts of the Web page. Five seconds was chosen because it is long enough to get a user's attention, but not so long that a user cannot wait out the distraction if necessary to use the page.</p>
									<p>Content that is paused can either resume in real-time or continue playing from the point in the presentation where the user left off.</p>
									<ol class="enumar">
										<li>
											<p>Pausing and resuming where the user left off is best for users who want to pause to read content and works best when the content is not associated with a real-time event or status.</p>
											<p class="prefix"><em>Note: </em>See <em><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/timing-adjustable"> Understanding Success Criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable</a></em> for additional requirements related to time-limits for reading.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Pausing and jumping to current display (when pause is released) is better for information that is real-time or "status" in nature. For example, weather radar, a stock ticker, a traffic camera, or an auction timer, would present misleading information if a pause caused it to display old information when the content was restarted.</p>
											<p class="prefix"><em>Note: </em>Hiding content would have the same result as pausing and jumping to current display (when pause is released).</p>
										</li>
									</ol>
									<p>For a mechanism to be considered "a mechanism for the user to pause," it must provide the user with a means to pause that does not tie up the user or the focus so that the page cannot be used. The word "pause" here is meant in the sense of a "pause button" although other mechanisms than a button can be used. Having an animation stop only so long as a user has focus on it (where it restarts as soon as the user moves the focus away) would not be considered a "mechanism for the user to pause" because it makes the page unusable in the process and would not meet this SC.</p>
									<p>It is important to note that the terms "blinking" and "flashing" can sometimes refer to the same content.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>"Blinking" refers to content that causes a distraction problem. Blinking can be allowed for a short time as long as it stops (or can be stopped)</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>"Flashing" refers to content that can trigger a seizure (if it is more than 3 per second and large and bright enough). This cannot be allowed even for a second or it could cause a seizure. And turning the flash off is also not an option since the seizure could occur faster than most users could turn it off.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Blinking usually does not occur at speeds of 3 per second or more, but it can. If blinking occurs faster than 3 per second, it would also be considered a flash.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>

									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>Providing content that stops blinking after five seconds or providing a mechanism for users to stop blinking content allows people with certain disabilities to interact with the Web page.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>One use of content that blinks is to draw the visitor's attention to that content. Although this is an effective technique for all users with vision, it can be a problem for some users if it persists. For certain groups, including people with low literacy, reading and intellectual disabilities, and people with attention deficit disorders, content that blinks may make it difficult or even impossible to interact with the rest of the Web page. </p>

								<p>Some people with seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered by flashing visual content. Most people are unaware that they have this disorder until it strikes. In 1997, a cartoon on television in Japan sent over 700 children to the hospital, including about 500 who had seizures. Warnings do not work well because they are often missed, especially by children who may in fact not be able to read them.</p>
								<p>The objective of this guideline is to ensure that content that is marked as conforming to WCAG 2.2 avoids the types of flash that are most likely to cause seizure when viewed even for a second or two.</p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow users to access the full content of a site without inducing seizures due to photosensitivity.</p>
									<p>Individuals who have photosensitive seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered by content that flashes at certain frequencies for more than a few flashes. People are even more sensitive to red flashing than to other colors, so a special test is provided for saturated red flashing. These guidelines are based on guidelines for the broadcasting industry as adapted for computer screens, where content is viewed from a closer distance (using a larger angle of vision).</p>
									<p>Flashing can be caused by the display, the computer rendering the image or by the content being rendered. The author has no control of the first two. They can be addressed by the design and speed of the display and computer. The intent of this criterion is to ensure that flicker that violates the flash thresholds is not caused by the content itself. For example, the content could contain a video clip or animated image of a series of strobe flashes, or close-ups of rapid-fire explosions. </p>
									<p>This Success Criterion replaces a much more restrictive criterion in WCAG 1.0 that did not allow any flashing (even of a single pixel) within a broad frequency range (3 to 50 Hz). This Success Criterion is based on existing specifications in use in the UK and by others for television broadcast and has been adapted for computer display viewing. The 1024 x 768 screen is used as the reference screen resolution for the evaluation. The 341 x 256 pixel block represents a 10 degree viewport at a typical viewing distance. (The 10 degree field is taken from the original specifications and represents the central vision portion of the eye, where people are most susceptible to photo stimuli.)</p>
									<p>The combined area of flashes occurring concurrently and contiguously means the total area that is actually flashing at the same time. It is calculated by adding up the contiguous area that is flashing simultaneously within any 10 degree angle of view.</p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note: </em>The terms "blinking" and "flashing" can sometimes refer to the same content.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>"Blinking" refers to content that causes a distraction problem. Blinking can be allowed for a short time as long as it stops (or can be stopped)</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>"Flashing" refers to content that can trigger a seizure (if it is more than 3 per second and large and bright enough). This cannot be allowed even for a second or it could cause a seizure. And turning the flash off is also not an option since the seizure could occur faster than most users could turn it off.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Blinking usually does not occur at speeds of 3 per second or more, but it can. If blinking occurs faster than 3 per second, it would also be considered a flash.</p>
										</li>

									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>Individuals who have seizures when viewing flashing material will be able to view all of the material on a site without having a seizure and without having to miss the full experience of the content by being limited to text alternatives. This includes people with photosensitive epilepsy as well as other photosensitive seizure disorders.</p>

								<p>The intent of this guideline is to help users find the content they need and allow them to keep track of their location. These tasks are often more difficult for people with disabilities. For finding, navigation, and orientation, it is important that the user can find out what the current location is. For navigation, information about the possible destinations needs to be available. Screen readers convert content to synthetic speech which, because it is audio, must be presented in linear order. Some Success Criteria in this guideline explain what provisions need to be taken to ensure that screen reader users can successfully navigate the content. Others allow users to more easily recognize navigation bars and page headers and to bypass this repeated content. Unusual user interface features or behaviors may confuse people with cognitive disabilities. </p>
								<p>As described in The <a href="http://www.motive.co.nz/glossary/navigation.php">Motive Web Design Glossary</a>, navigation has two main functions:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p>to tell the user where they are</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>to enable the user to go somewhere else</p>
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This guideline works closely with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#adaptable">Guideline 1.3</a>, which ensures that any structure in the content can be perceived, a key to navigation as well. Headings are particularly important mechanisms for helping users orient themselves within content and navigate through it. Many users of assistive technologies rely on appropriate headings to skim through information and easily locate the different sections of content. Satisfying <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships">Success Criterion 1.3.1 </a> for headings also addresses some aspects of Guideline 2.4.</p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow people who navigate sequentially through content more direct access to the primary content of the Web page. Web pages and applications often have content that appears on other pages or screens. Examples of repeated blocks of content include but are not limited to navigation links, heading graphics, and advertising frames. Small repeated sections such as individual words, phrases or single links are not considered blocks for the purposes of this provision. </p>
									<p>This is in contrast to a sighted user's ability to ignore the repeated material either by focusing on the center of the screen (where main content usually appears) or a mouse user's ability to select a link with a single mouse click rather than encountering every link or form control that comes before the item they want.</p>
									<p>It is not the intent of this Success Criterion to require authors to provide methods that are redundant to functionality provided by the user agent. Most web browsers provide keyboard shortcuts to move the user focus to the top of the page, so if a set of navigation links is provided at the bottom of a web page providing a "skip" link may be unnecessary.</p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note: </em>Although this Success Criterion deals with blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages, we also strongly promote structural markup on individual pages as per Success Criteria 1.3.1. </p>
									<p>Although the success criterion does not specifically use the term “within a set of web pages”, the concept of the pages belonging to a set is implied. An author would not be expected to avoid any possible duplication of content in any two pages that are not in some way related to each other; that are not "Web pages that share a common purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization” (the definition of set of web pages).</p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note: </em>Even for web pages that are not in a set, if a web page has blocks of text that are repeated within the page it may be helpful (but not required) to provide a means to skip over them.</p>

											<p>When this Success Criterion is not satisfied, it may be difficult for people with some disabilities to reach the main content of a Web page quickly and easily.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Screen reader users who visit several pages on the same site can avoid having to hear all heading graphics and dozens of navigation links on every page before the main content is spoken.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>People who use only the keyboard or a keyboard interface can reach content with fewer keystrokes. Otherwise, they might have to make dozens of keystrokes before reaching a link in the main content area. This can take a long time and may cause severe physical pain for some users. </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>People who use screen magnifiers do not have to search through the same headings or other blocks of information to find where the content begins each time they enter a new page.</p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users find content and orient themselves within it by ensuring that each Web page has a descriptive title.

User agents make the title of the page easily available to the user for identifying the page.

									<p>In cases where the page is a document or a web application, the name of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page.

								<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order#intent" class="sc intent">
									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that when users navigate sequentially through content, they encounter information in an order that is consistent with the meaning of the content and can be operated from the keyboard. This reduces confusion by letting users form a consistent mental model of the content. There may be different orders that reflect logical relationships in the content. For example, moving through components in a table one row at a time or one column at a time both reflect the logical relationships in the content. Either order may satisfy this Success Criterion.</p>
									<p>The way that sequential navigation order is determined in Web content is defined by the technology of the content. For example, simple HTML defines sequential navigation via the notion of tabbing order. Dynamic HTML may modify the navigation sequence using scripting along with the addition of a tabindex attribute to allow focus to additional elements. If no scripting or tabindex attributes are used, the navigation order is the order that components appear in the content stream. (See HTML 4.01 Specification, section 17.11, "Giving focus to an element").</p>
									<p>An example of keyboard navigation that is not the sequential navigation addressed by this Success Criterion is using arrow key navigation to traverse a tree component. The user can use the up and down arrow keys to move from tree node to tree node. Pressing the right arrow key may expand a node, then using the down arrow key, will move into the newly expanded nodes. This navigation sequence follows the expected sequence for a tree control - as additional items get expanded or collapsed, they are added or removed from the navigation sequence.</p>
									<p>The focus order may not be identical to the programmatically determined reading order (see Success Criterion 1.3.2) as long as the user can still understand and operate the Web page. Since there may be several possible logical reading orders for the content, the focus order may match any of them. However, when the order of a particular presentation differs from the programmatically determined reading order, users of one of these presentations may find it difficult to understand or operate the Web page. Authors should carefully consider all these users as they design their Web pages.</p>
									<p>For example, a screen reader user interacts with the programmatically determined reading order, while a sighted keyboard user interacts with the visual presentation of the Web page. Care should be taken so that the focus order makes sense to both of these sets of users and does not appear to either of them to jump around randomly. </p>
									<p>For clarity:</p>
									<ol class="enumar">
										<li>
											<p>Focusable components need to receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability only when navigation sequences affect meaning and operability.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>In those cases where it is required, there may be more than one order that will preserve meaning and operability.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>If there is more than one order that preserves meaning and operability, only one of them needs to be provided.</p>
										</li>
									</ol>

									<p>These techniques benefit keyboard users who navigate documents sequentially and expect the focus order to be consistent with the sequential reading order.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>People with mobility impairments who must rely on keyboard access for operating a page benefit from a logical, usable focus order.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>People with disabilities that make reading difficult can become disoriented when tabbing takes focus someplace unexpected. They benefit from a logical focus order.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>People with visual impairments can become disoriented when tabbing takes focus someplace unexpected or when they cannot easily find the content surrounding an interactive element.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Only a small portion of the page may be visible to an individual using a screen magnifier at a high level of magnification. Such a user may interpret a field in the wrong context if the focus order is not logical.</p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand the purpose of each link so they can decide whether they want to follow the link. Whenever possible, provide link text that identifies the purpose of the link without needing additional context. Assistive technology has the ability to provide users with a list of links that are on the Web page. Link text that is as meaningful as possible will aid users who want to choose from this list of links. Meaningful link text also helps those who wish to tab from link to link. Meaningful links help users choose which links to follow without requiring complicated strategies to understand the page.</p>
									<p>The text of, or associated with, the link is intended to describe the purpose of the link. In cases where the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the link (which is to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is not required to use the name of the document or web application; other things may also describe the purpose of the link. </p>
									<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/page-titled">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> deals with the titles of pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page. Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on. </p>
									<p>In some situations, authors may want to provide part of the description of the link in logically related text that provides the context for the link. In this case the user should be able to identify the purpose of the link without moving focus from the link. In other words, they can arrive on a link and find out more about it without losing their place. This can be achieved by putting the description of the link in the same sentence, paragraph, list item, the heading immediately preceding the link, or table cell as the link, or in the table header cell for a link in a data table, because these are directly associated with the link itself. </p>
									<p>This context will be most usable if it precedes the link. (For instance, if you must use ambiguous link text, it is better to put it at the end of the sentence that describes its destination, rather than putting the ambiguous phrase at the beginning of the sentence.) If the description follows the link, there can be confusion and difficulty for screen reader users who are reading through the page in order (top to bottom). </p>
									<p>Links with the same destination should have the same descriptions (per <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#consistent-identification">Success Criterion 3.2.4</a>), but links with different purposes and destinations should have different descriptions. </p>
									<p>The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation, the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available on the Web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made available in the link text or programmatically associated with the link to satisfy the Success Criterion.</p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note: </em>There may be situations where the purpose of the link is is supposed to be unknown or obscured. For instance, a game may have links identified only as door #1, door #2, and door #3. This link text would be sufficient because the purpose of the links is to create suspense for all users.</p>

For some users, it is difficult to infer the meaning of a word or phrase from context, especially when the word or phrase is used in an unusual way or has been given a specialized meaning; for these users the ability to read and understand may depend on the availability of specific definitions or the expanded forms of acronyms or abbreviations.

								<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/language-of-parts#intent" class="sc intent">
									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user agents can correctly present content written in multiple languages. This makes it possible for user agents and assistive technologies to present content according to the presentation and pronunciation rules for that language. This applies to graphical browsers as well as screen readers, braille displays, and other voice browsers.</p>
									<p>Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately if the language of each passage of text is identified. Screen readers can use the pronunciation rules of the language of the text. Visual browsers can display characters and scripts in appropriate ways. This is especially important when switching between languages that read from left to right and languages that read from right to left, or when text is rendered in a language that uses a different alphabet. Users with disabilities who know all the languages used in the Web page will be better able to understand the content when each passage is rendered appropriately. </p>
									<p>When no other language has been specified for a phrase or passage of text, its human language is the default human language of the Web page (see Success Criterion 3.1.1). So the human language of all content in single language documents can be programmatically determined. </p>
									<p>Individual words or phrases in one language can become part of another language. For example, "rendezvous" is a French word that has been adopted in English, appears in English dictionaries, and is properly pronounced by English screen readers. Hence a passage of English text may contain the word "rendezvous" without specifying that its human language is French and still satisfy this Success Criterion. Frequently, when the human language of text appears to be changing for a single word, that word has become part of the language of the surrounding text. Because this is so common in some languages, single words should be considered part of the language of the surrounding text unless it is clear that a change in language was intended. If there is doubt whether a change in language is intended, consider whether the word would be pronounced the same (except for accent or intonation) in the language of the immediately surrounding text. </p>
									<p>Most professions require frequent use of technical terms which may originate from a foreign language. Such terms are usually not translated to all languages. The universal nature of technical terms also facilitate communication between professionals.</p>
									<p>Some common examples of technical terms include: Homo sapiens, Alpha Centauri, hertz, and habeas corpus.</p>
									<p>Identifying changes in language is important for a number of reasons: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>It allows braille translation software to follow changes in language, e.g., substitute control codes for accented characters, and insert control codes necessary to prevent erroneous creation of Grade 2 braille contractions.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages will be able to speak the text in the appropriate accent with proper pronunciation. If changes are not marked, the synthesizer will try its best to speak the words in the default language it works in. Thus, the French word for car, "voiture" would be pronounced "voyture" by a speech synthesizer that uses English as its default language. </p>

								<p>The intent of this Guideline is to help users with disabilities by presenting content in a predictable order from Web page to Web page and by making the behavior of functional and interactive components predictable. It is difficult for some users to form an overview of the Web page: screen readers present content as a one-dimensional stream of synthetic speech that makes it difficult to understand spatial relationships. Users with cognitive limitations may become confused if components appear in different places on different pages.</p>
								<p>For example, people who use screen magnifiers see only part of the screen at any point in time; a consistent layout makes it easier for them to find navigation bars and other components. Placing repeated components in the same relative order within a set of Web pages allows users with reading disabilities to focus on an area of the screen rather than spending additional time decoding the text of each link. Users with limited use of their hands can more easily determine how to complete their tasks using the fewest keystrokes.</p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure consistent identification of functional components that appear repeatedly within a set of Web pages. A strategy that people who use screen readers use when operating a Web site is to rely heavily on their familiarity with functions that may appear on different Web pages. If identical functions have different labels on different Web pages, the site will be considerably more difficult to use. It may also be confusing and increase the cognitive load for people with cognitive limitations. Therefore, consistent labeling will help. </p>
									<p>This consistency extends to the text alternatives. If icons or other non-text items have the same functionality, then their text alternatives should be consistent as well.</p>
									<p>If there are two components on a web page that both have the same functionality as a component on another page in a set of web pages, then all 3 must be consistent. Hence the two on the same page will be consistent.</p>
									<p>While it is desirable and best practice always to be consistent within a single web page, 3.2.4 only addresses consistency within a set of web pages where something is repeated on more than one page in the set.</p>

											<p>People who learn functionality on one page on a site can find the desired functions on other pages if they are present.</p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users are aware that an error has occurred and can determine what is wrong. The error message should be as specific as possible. In the case of an unsuccessful form submission, re-displaying the form and indicating the fields in error is insufficient for some users to perceive that an error has occurred. Screen reader users, for example, will not know there was an error until they encounter one of the indicators. They may abandon the form altogether before encountering the error indicator, thinking that the page simply is not functional. Per the definition in WCAG 2.2, an "input error" is information provided by the user that is not accepted. This includes: </p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>information that is required by the web page but omitted by the user, or</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data format or allowed values.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>For example:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<p>the user fails to enter the proper abbreviation in to state, province, region, etc. field; </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>the user enters a state abbreviation that is not a valid state; </p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>the user enters a non existent zip or postal code;</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>the user enters a birth date 2 years in the future;</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>the user enters alphabetic characters or parentheses into their phone number field that only accepts numbers;</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<p>the user enters a bid that is below the previous bid or the minimum bid increment.</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note: </em>If a user enters a value that is too high or too low, and the coding on the page automatically changes that value to fall within the allowed range, the user's error would still need to be described to them as required by the success criterion. Such an error description telling the person of the changed value would meet both this success criterion (Error Identification) and <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-suggestion">Success Criterion 3.3.3 (Error Suggestion)</a>. </p>
									<p>The identification and description of an error can be combined with programmatic information that user agents or assistive technologies can use to identify an error and provide error information to the user. For example, certain technologies can specify that the user's input must not fall outside a specific range, or that a form field is required. Currently, few technologies support this kind of programmatic information, but the Success Criterion does not require, nor prevent it. </p>
									<p>It is perfectly acceptable to indicate the error in other ways such as image, color etc, in addition to the text description. </p>

											<p> Providing information about input errors in text allows users who are blind or colorblind to perceive the fact that an error occurred. </p>

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid serious consequences as the result of a mistake when performing an action that cannot be reversed. For example, purchasing non-refundable airline tickets or submitting an order to purchase stock in a brokerage account are financial transactions with serious consequences. If a user has made a mistake on the date of air travel, he or she could end up with a ticket for the wrong day that cannot be exchanged. If the user made a mistake on the number of stock shares to be purchased, he or she could end up purchasing more stock than intended. Both of these types of mistakes involve transactions that take place immediately and cannot be altered afterwards, and can be very costly. Likewise, it may be an unrecoverable error if users unintentionally modify or delete data stored in a database that they later need to access, such as their entire travel profile in a travel services web site. When
										referring to modification or deletion of 'user controllable' data, the intent is to prevent mass loss of data such as deleting a file or record. It is not the intent to require a confirmation for each save command or the simple creation or editing of documents, records or other data.</p>
									<p>Users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes. People with reading disabilities may transpose numbers and letters, and those with motor disabilities may hit keys by mistake. Providing the ability to reverse actions allows users to correct a mistake that could result in serious consequences. Providing the ability to review and correct information gives the user an opportunity to detect a mistake before taking an action that has serious consequences.</p>
									<p>User-controllable data is user-viewable data that the user can change and/or delete through an intentional action. Examples of the user controlling such data would be updating the phone number and address for the user's account, or deleting a record of past invoices from a website. It does not refer such things as internet logs and search engine monitoring data that the user can't view or interact with directly. </p>

								<p>The purpose of this guideline is to support compatibility with current and future user agents, <em>especially</em> assistive technologies (AT). This is done both by 1) ensuring that authors do not do things that would break AT (e.g., poorly formed markup) or circumvent AT (e.g., by using unconventional markup or code) and 2) exposing information in the content in standard ways that assistive technologies can recognize and interact with.

									<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user agents, including assistive technologies, can accurately interpret and parse content. If the content cannot be parsed into a data structure, then different user agents may present it differently or be completely unable to parse it. Some user agents use "repair techniques" to render poorly coded content. </p>
									<p>Since repair techniques vary among user agents, authors cannot assume that content will be accurately parsed into a data structure or that it will be rendered correctly by specialized user agents, including assistive technologies, unless the content is created according to the rules defined in the formal grammar for that technology. In markup languages, errors in element and attribute syntax and failure to provide properly nested start/end tags lead to errors that prevent user agents from parsing the content reliably. Therefore, the Success Criterion requires that the content can be parsed using only the rules of the formal grammar. </p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note 1: </em>The concept of "well formed" is close to what is required here. However, exact parsing requirements vary amongst markup languages, and most non XML-based languages do not explicitly define requirements for well formedness. Therefore, it was necessary to be more explicit in the success criterion in order to be generally applicable to markup languages. Because the term "well formed" is only defined in XML, and (because end tags are sometimes optional) valid HTML does not require well formed code, the term is not used in this success criterion.</p>
									<p class="prefix"><em>Note 2: </em>With the exception of one success criterion (<em><a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text"> Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize text</a></em>, which specifically mentions that the effect specified by the success criterion must be achieved without relying on an assistive technology) authors can meet the success criteria with content that assumes use of an assistive technology (or access features in use agents) by the user, where such assistive technologies (or access features in user agents) exist and are available to the user.</p>

Alternate accessibility provisions that would be needed to address the purpose of these success criteria for the closed functionality aspects of products:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#non-text-content">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a>—requires text or a text alternative;</li>

				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded">1.2.3 Audio description or Media Alternative</a>—one of the options available to authors for success criterion 1.2.3 is that of providing a media alternative that is text—which necessarily relies on a connected assistive technology to be presented;</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>—requires information in a programmatically determinable form;</li>

				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a>—because the text rendering support in a closed environment may be more limited than the support found in user agents for the Web, meeting Success Criterion 1.4.4 in a closed environment may place a much heavier burden on the content author;</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#images-of-text">1.4.5 Images of Text</a>—because there is no need to impose a requirement on all closed functionality that text displayed on the screen actually be represented internally as text (as defined by WCAG 2.2), given that there is no interoperability with assistive technology;</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#keyboard">2.1.1 Keyboard</a>—requires operation via a keyboard interface which allows alternative input devices;</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#page-titled">2.4.2 Page Titled</a>—where software is an integral part of hardware that provides a single function, such as a calculator or IP telephone, there is no need for a title;</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#language-of-page">3.1.1 Language of Page</a>—requires information in a programmatically determinable form;</li>

				<p>The interface of a text application is realized through a text application directing which characters should be placed on the screen, along with either a hardware terminal or a terminal application that displays the characters produced by the text application. Some text applications render like a TeleTYpewriter (“TTY”); their output is always appended, like an ever growing file. Such text applications are often called “command-line applications” or occasionally “TTY-applications”, and their output can optionally be redirected to a file for later review. Others explicitly place text into a matrix of fixed width character cells on a screen (sometimes with specific foreground and background colors). Similar to a web application, the text application may execute primarily on a remote server or execute locally, and a local client terminal application handles the visual display (similar to a web user agent). Input to the text application itself is provided exclusively through a
					keyboard interface.</p>

			<section id="how-text-applications-have-been-made-accessible-via-assistive-technology"><div class="header-wrapper"><h3 id="b-2-how-text-applications-have-been-made-accessible-via-assistive-technology"><bdi class="secno">B.2 </bdi>How text applications have been made accessible via assistive technology</h3><a class="self-link" href="#how-text-applications-have-been-made-accessible-via-assistive-technology" aria-label="Permalink for Appendix B.2"></a></div>
				
				<p>Strategies for making text applications accessible through assistive technology involve two key tasks: (1) obtaining all of the text displayed in the interface, and (2) performing an analysis on that text to discern structural elements and screen updates.</p>
				<p>For example, a text application screen reader might directly access the matrix of character cells in the interface and provide a screen review mechanism for the user to review that matrix of characters (by sending the output to synthetic speech and / or a braille display). Alternately, a text application screen reader might directly consume the output rendered (perhaps by acting as its own terminal application or by analyzing the “TTY” output). The text application screen reader would also analyze the spacing and layout of the text in the matrix to provide features such as reading columns of text in a multi-column layout, discerning headers through analysis of line spacing, indentation and capitalization, and discerning input fields or user interface components, etc. by scanning for the use of inverse video or for text appearing in brackets or text from the character graphics codepage (ASCII codes greater than ‘0x7F’). Some of this analysis might also be done through the use
					of filter tools that transform the output of a program (e.g. through reformatting “TTY” output rendered to a file or as direct input to a filter too).</p>
				<p>Similarly, a text application screen magnifier would gain access to the matrix of character cells in order to magnify them or re-display them in a larger font. It would scan for screen refreshes / updates and apply heuristics to what had changed in order to decide what sub-matrix of character cells should appear in a magnified view. It would also scan for inverse video and a moving text cursor to track text being input by the user (and might combine the text matrix scanning with scanning of the keyboard input to match user input to what is appearing on the screen).</p>

				<p>To apply WCAG to text applications, it is necessary to apply the glossary terms “accessibility supported” and “programmatically determined” in the context of how text applications are rendered and the history of assistive technologies that made them accessible.</p>
				<p>As noted above, in a text interface the terminal application renders the characters on the screen, just as a web browser typically renders content for a web application. Thus for example, in success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a>, a text application could achieve 200 percent resizing when the terminal application client that is rendering it has this capability (cf. WCAG 2.2 Technique <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G142">G142 Using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that support zoom</a>). Many web pages and web applications use this approach to meet success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a> through no explicit action of their own.</p>
				<p>A similar approach could also be used for success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (minimum)</a> (cf. WCAG 2.2 Technique <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G148">G148: Not specifying background color, not specifying text color, and not using technology features that change those defaults</a>): relying on the terminal application client to render the text with sufficient contrast against the background. In fact, many terminal applications allow the user to force all text to share a single user-chosen foreground color (and a single user-chosen background color), overriding the text application's specified colors in order to meet the user's desires or needs.</p>
				<p>Since many assistive technology analysis techniques depend upon discerning the location of the text input cursor, terminal application use of “soft cursors” and “highlight bars” may bypass those analysis techniques and cause failures of success criteria.</p>
				<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-180"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-179" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">It is outside of the scope of this document to define WCAG techniques for non-web ICT. These examples are simply raised here to illustrate how WCAG 2.2 success criteria can be applied to this older class of applications that pre-date the Web.</p></div>
				<p>The way to think about “<a href="http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_accessibility-supported">accessibility supported</a>” and “<a href="http://w3c.github.io/wcag2ict/#wcag2ict-def_programmaticallydetermined">programmatically determined</a>” may seem a little different for text applications, but the definitions are unchanged. Because assistive technologies developed analysis techniques to recognize many forms of tabular layout, column headers, and section headings, such recognized layouts are by definition “accessibility supported”. Where assistive technology is able to extract and present that information, it is “programmatically determinable”—even though no explicit markup or <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> was used to make it so. While such assistive technology analysis techniques are not used for supporting newer technologies, the fact that such previous analysis work was done allows us to apply WCAG 2.2 to text / command-line applications.</p>

It is only for the text application that there is a need to take this approach with these glossary terms.</p></div>
