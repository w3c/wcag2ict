		<section id="abstract" class="introductory"><h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This document, “Guidance on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)” describes how the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) versions 2.0 [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag20" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0">WCAG20</a></cite>], 2.1 [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag21" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1">WCAG21</a></cite>], and 2.2 [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag22" title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2">WCAG22</a></cite>] principles, guidelines, and success criteria can be applied to non-web Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), specifically to non-web documents and software. It provides informative guidance (guidance that is not normative and does not set requirements).</p>
<p>This document is part of a series of technical and educational documents published by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/"><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a> and available from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/">WCAG2ICT Overview</a>.</p>

		<section id="sotd" class="introductory"><h2>Status of This Document</h2><p><em>This section describes the status of this
      document at the time of its publication. A list of current <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
      publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found
      in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/"><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> technical reports index</a> at
      https://www.w3.org/TR/.</em></p><p>This is a Technical Report on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT). The intent of this work is to update the existing guidance to include the new and changed WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 success criteria.</p>
<p>The current draft includes guidance for all of the WCAG 2 success criteria from WCAG 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2. The next draft will also address open issues on WCAG 2.0 criteria. </p>
<p>The group is seeking feedback on the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>New added guidance for WCAG 2.1 success criteria and glossary term definitions</li>
<li>Updates to the closed functionality guidance for new WCAG 2.1 success criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>The group is already aware of formatting differences in how quoted passages from WCAG are included in comparison to the previous WCAG2ICT Working Group Note.</p>
<p>Currently there are known issues in the quoted content from WCAG and Understanding Intent sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anchor links from the included WCAG content to sections that do not exist in the WCAG2ICT document don't work</li>
<li>The words "Note" and "Example" are missing from notes and examples of quoted WCAG passages</li>
</ul>
<p>The group is currently working on updates to the format, styling, and linking for these passages, and expects to refine these in a future draft.</p>
<p>

<p>This document is an update to a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr#WGNote">Working Group Note</a> to incorporate new guidelines, success criteria, and definitions added in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-wcag2ict-20130905/">Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)</a>, approved in September 2013, described how WCAG 2.0 could be applied to non-web documents and software. WCAG2ICT was organized to mirror WCAG's sections: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.  WCAG2ICT clarified when and how WCAG success criteria should be applied to non-web documents and software.  Some were applicable without modification and some were applicable with edits and/or notes.  Glossary terms were also reviewed. Level AAA Success Criteria were not addressed in the 2013 WCAG2ICT Working Group Note. </p>
<p>The 2013 WCAG2ICT has been relied upon in regulations and legislation.  One example is EN 301 549[^1] (Europe) and other standards that reference or incorporate EN 301 549 (e.g., India, Kenya, Australia).  Another example is Section 508 (U.S.) <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/18/2017-00395/information-and-communication-technology-ict-standards-and-guidelines#h-36">Application of WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web ICT</a>, which looked to WCAG2ICT for detailed direction with providing specific guidance and exceptions to particular criteria from being applied to non-web technology.  Section 508 incorporated by reference WCAG as the <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#E205.4">Accessibility Standard applicable to non-web documents</a> and requires <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#E207.2">WCAG Conformance for non-web software</a>.</p>

It will be re-examined once the Task Force has finished analyzing all of the new WCAG criteria to ensure the summarization of applicability of WCAG criteria to non-web documents and software is accurate.</div></div>

<p>This document provides informative guidance (guidance that is not <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-normative">normative</a> and that does not set requirements) with regard to the interpretation and application of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT). This document is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#WGNote">Working Group Note</a> (in contrast to WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1, and WCAG 2.2, which are <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Recommendations).  Specifically, this document provides informative guidance on applying WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 Level A and AA success criteria to non-web ICT, specifically to non-web documents and software.  </p>
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-0"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note" aria-level="4"><span>Note 1</span></div><div class="">Hereafter, the use of WCAG 2 means all WCAG 2.x versions - 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2.</div></div>

<p>This document is intended to help clarify how to use WCAG 2 to make non-web documents and software more accessible to people with disabilities. Addressing accessibility involves addressing the needs of people with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities, and the needs of people with accessibility requirements due to the effects of aging. </p>
<p>Although this document covers a wide range of issues, it is not able to address all the needs of all people with disabilities. Since WCAG 2 was developed for the Web, addressing accessibility for non-web documents and software may involve requirements and considerations beyond those included in this document. Authors and developers are encouraged to seek relevant advice about current best practices to ensure that non-web documents and software are accessible, as much as possible, to people with disabilities.  The following WCAG 2 supporting documents, though they have not been changed to fully apply in non-web contexts, contain helpful information to learn about the user needs, intent, and generalized implementation techniques:</p>

</ul>
<p>While WCAG 2 was designed to be technology-neutral, it assumes the presence of a “user agent” such as a browser, media player, or assistive technology as a means to access web content. Therefore, the application of WCAG 2 to documents and software in non-web contexts required some interpretation in order to determine how the intent of each WCAG 2 success criterion could be met in these different contexts of use. Therefore, the bulk of the Task Force's work involved evaluating how each WCAG 2 success criterion would apply in the context of non-web ICT, if it were applied to non-web ICT.</p>
<p>The Task Force found that the majority of success criteria from WCAG 2 can apply to non-web documents and software with either no or minimal changes. Since many of the Level A and AA success criteria do not include any web related terms, they apply directly as written and as described in the “Intent” sections from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/">Understanding WCAG 2.2</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-understanding-wcag22" title="Understanding Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2">UNDERSTANDING-WCAG22</a></cite>] resource. Additional notes were provided, as needed, to provide assistance in applying them to non-web documents and software.</p>
<p>When certain Web-specific terms or phrases like “web page(s)” were used in success criteria, those were replaced with non-web terms or phrases like “non-web document(s) and software”. Additional notes were also provided to explain the terminology replacements.</p>
<p>A small number of success criteria are written to apply to “a set of web pages” or “multiple web pages” and require all pages in the set to share some characteristic or behavior. Since the unit of conformance in WCAG 2 is a single web page, the task force agreed that the equivalent unit of conformance for non-web documents is a single document. It follows that an equivalent unit of evaluation for a “set of web pages” would be a ”set of documents”. Since it isn't possible to unambiguously carve up non-web software into discrete pieces, a single “web page” was equated to a “software program” and a “set of web pages” was equated to a “set of software programs.&nbsp; Both of these new terms are defined in the Key Terms section of this document. See “<a href="#set-of-documents">set of documents</a>” and “<a href="#set-of-software-programs">set of software programs</a>” to determine when a group of documents or pieces of software are considered a set. </p>

<p>The glossary terms were also reviewed and most of them applied to non-Web documents and software, as written. Some applied with additional notes or edits (largely related to phrases like “Web page(s)”), and a small number of terms were only used in Level AAA success criteria which are not addressed by the WCAG2ICT Note at this time.</p>

<p>The following are out of scope for this document:</p>
<ul>
<li>This document does not seek to determine which WCAG 2 provisions (principles, guidelines, or success criteria) should or should not apply to non-web documents and software, but rather how they would apply, if applied.</li>
<li>This document does not propose changes to WCAG 2 or its supporting documents; it does not include interpretations for implementing WCAG 2 in web technologies. During the development of this document, the WCAG2ICT Task Force did seek clarification on the intent of a number of the success criteria, which led to clarifications in the Understanding WCAG 2 document.</li>
<li>This document is not sufficient by itself to ensure accessibility in non-web documents and software. As a web standard, WCAG does not fully cover all accessibility requirements for non-user interface aspects of platforms, user-interface components as individual items, nor closed product software (where there is no Assistive Technology to communicate programmatic information).</li>
<li>This document does not comment on hardware aspects of products, because the basic constructs on which WCAG 2 is built do not apply to these.</li>
<li>This document does not provide supporting techniques for implementing WCAG 2 in non-web documents and software.</li>
<li>This document is purely an informative Note about non-web ICT, not a standard, so it does not describe how non-web ICT should conform to it.</li>

		<section id="key-terms"><div class="header-wrapper"><h2 id="x2-key-terms">Key Terms</h2><a class="self-link" href="#key-terms" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2."></a></div>
<p>WCAG2ICT provides some key glossary terms to address differences between web and non-web contexts and to introduce terms that are nonexistent in WCAG but important to define for a non-web context. “Content” and “user agent” are glossary terms from WCAG 2 that need to be interpreted significantly differently when applied to non-web ICT. The glossary term “Web page” in WCAG 2 is replaced with newly defined terms “document” and “software”, and both “set of web pages” and “multiple web pages” are replaced with the newly defined terms “set of documents” and “set of software programs”. The new terms introduced by WCAG2ICT are “accessibility services of platform software” because non-Web software doesn't leverage the WCAG notion of a user agent, and "closed functionality" which is specific to non-web software. The remaining glossary terms from WCAG 2 are addressed in <a href="#comments-on-definitions-in-wcag-2-glossary">Chapter 7 Comments on Definitions in WCAG 2 Glossary</a>. Terms defined and used in WCAG2ICT are applicable only to the interpretation of the guidance in this document. The particular definitions should not be interpreted as having applicability to situations beyond the scope of WCAG2ICT. Further information on usage of these terms follows.</p>

<p>The term <strong>accessibility services of platform software</strong>, as used in WCAG2ICT, has the meaning below:</p>
<dl><dt>accessibility services of platform software (as used in WCAG2ICT)</dt><dd>

<p>services provided by an operating system, <a href="#user-agent">user agent</a>, or other platform software that enable non-web <a href="#document">documents</a> or <a href="#software">software</a> to expose information about the user interface and events to assistive technologies and accessibility features of software

<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-4"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-1" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><div class="">

<p>These services are commonly provided in the form of accessibility APIs (application programming interfaces), and they provide two-way communication with assistive technologies, including exposing information about objects and events.</p></div></div><p></p>

<p>The term <strong>closed functionality</strong>, as used in WCAG2ICT, has the meaning below:</p>
<dl><dt>closed functionality (as used in WCAG2ICT)</dt><dd>
  
<p>a property or characteristic that prevents users from attaching, installing, or using <a href="#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technology</a></p></dd></dl><p></p>
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-5"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-2" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><div class="">
  
<p>To support users with disabilities, products with closed functionality might instead provide built-in features that function as assistive technology or use other mechanisms to make the technology accessible.</p></div></div>
<div class="example">
  
<p><span>Example: </span>Examples of technology with closed functionality include: </p>
<ul>
<li>self-service transaction machines or kiosks - examples include machines used for retail self-checkout, point of sales (POS) terminals, ticketing and self check-in, and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs).</li>
<li>telephony devices such as IP phones, feature phones, smartphones, and phone-enabled tablets (although such devices are becoming increasingly open and/or supplying AT and accessibility features that software can rely upon to meet WCAG requirements.)</li>
<li>entertainment technologies including smart TVs, set-top boxes, smart displays, smart speakers, smart watches, and tablets</li>
<li>an ebook reader or standalone ebook software that allows assistive technologies to access all of the user interface controls of the ebook program (open functionality) but does not allow the assistive technologies to access the actual content of book (closed functionality).</li>
<li>an operating system that requires the user to provide log in credentials before it allows any assistive technologies to be loaded. The log-in portion would be closed functionality.</li>
<li>other technology devices, such as printers, displays, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. </li></ul></div>

<p>These examples are explained more fully in the <a href="#comments-on-closed-functionality">Comments on Closed Functionality</a> section.</p>

<p>WCAG 2 defines <strong>content</strong> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-agents">user agent</a>, including code or markup that defines the content's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-structure">structure</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-presentation">presentation</a>, and interactions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For non-web content it is necessary to view this a bit more broadly. Within WCAG2ICT, the term “content” is used as follows:</p>
<dl><dt>content (non-web content) (as used in WCAG2ICT)</dt><dd>

<p>information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of <strong><ins>[<a href="#software">software</a>]</ins></strong>, including code or markup that defines the content's <a href="#dfn-structure">structure</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-presentation">presentation</a>, and interactions

<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-6"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-3" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><div class="">

<p>Non-web content occurs in two places; documents and software. When content occurs in a document, a user agent is needed in order to communicate the content's information and sensory experience to the user. When content occurs in software, a separate user agent isn't required—the software itself performs that function.</p></div></div><p></p>
<p>Within WCAG2ICT wherever “content” or “web content” appears in a success criterion it is replaced with “content” using the definition above.</p>
</section><section id="document"><div class="header-wrapper"><h3 id="x2-4-document">Document</h3><a class="self-link" href="#document" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.4"></a></div>
<p>The term <strong>document</strong>, as used in WCAG2ICT, has the meaning below:</p>
<dl><dt>document (as used in WCAG2ICT)</dt><dd>

<p>assembly of <a href="#content-on-and-off-the-web">content</a>, such as a file, set of files, or streamed media that functions as a single item rather than a collection, that is not part of software and that does not include its own user agent

<p>Software configuration and storage files such as databases and virus definitions, as well as computer instruction files such as source code, batch/script files, and firmware, are examples of files that function as part of <a href="#software">software</a> and thus are not examples of documents. If and where software retrieves “information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user” from such files, it is just another part of the content that occurs in software and is covered by WCAG2ICT like any other parts of the software. Where such files contain one or more embedded documents, the embedded documents remain documents under this definition.</p></div></div><p></p>
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-10"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-7" aria-level="4"><span>Note 4</span></div><div class="">

<p>Although the term “software” is used throughout this document because this would apply to stand alone software programs as well as individual software components and the software components in software-hardware combinations, the concept of “set of software programs” would only apply (by definition) to programs that can be launched separately from each other. Therefore, in the WCAG2ICT guidance for the provisions that use the phrase “set of” (success criteria 2.4.1, 2.4.5, 3.2.3, 3.2.4, and 3.2.6), the phrase “set of software programs” is used.</p></div></div><p></p>

<ul>
<li>A suite of programs for authoring different types of documents (text, spreadsheets, presentations, etc.) where the programs don't provide an explicit, consistent means to launch, or switch to, each of the other programs in the group.</li>
<li>An office package consisting of multiple programs that launches as a single program that provides multiple functionalities such as writing, spreadsheet, etc., but the only way to navigate between programs is to open a document in one of the programs.</li>
<li>A bundle of software programs that is sold together but the only way to navigate between the programs in the bundle is to use a platform software level menu to navigate between them (and not via a menu provided by each program that allows you to navigate to just the other programs in this bundle).</li>
<li>A group of programs that was a set, but the programs have been moved to separate locations so that their “set” behaviors were disrupted and no longer work. Even though they <em>were</em> a set at one time, because they are no longer installed as a set they no longer <em>are</em> a set and would not need to meet any success criteria that apply to sets of software.</li></ul></div>

<dl><dt>software (as used in WCAG2ICT)</dt><dd>

<p>software products or software aspects of hardware-software products that have a user interface and do not require a separate <a href="#user-agent">user agent</a> to present any of its <a href="#content-on-and-off-the-web">content</a>

<p>Because software with a user interface provides a function equivalent to a user agent in addition to content, the application of some WCAG 2 success criteria would be different for content embedded in software versus content in a document, where it is viewed through a separate user agent (e.g. browser, player, viewer, etc.).</p></div></div><p></p>
</section><section id="user-agent"><div class="header-wrapper"><h3 id="x2-9-user-agent">User Agent</h3><a class="self-link" href="#user-agent" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.9"></a></div>
<p>WCAG 2 defines <strong>user agent</strong> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl><dt>user agent</dt><dd>

<p>any software that retrieves and presents Web content for users</p>
</dd></dl></blockquote>

<div class="example">

<p><span>Example: </span>Web browsers, media players, plug-ins, and other programs—including <a href="#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive technologies</a>—that help in retrieving, rendering, and interacting with Web content.</p></blockquote></div>
For non-web ICT, “user agent” needs to be viewed differently. In WCAG 2, the term “user agent” only refers to retrieval and display of web content. For non-web ICT, the term “user agent” refers to retrieval and display of separate content that is <em>not on the Web</em>, which WCAG2ICT refers to as a “document”. Within WCAG2ICT, the term “user agent” is used as follows:<p></p>

<dl><dt>user agent (as used in WCAG2ICT)</dt><dd>

<p>any <a href="#software">software</a> that retrieves and presents <strong><ins>[documents]</ins></strong> for users

<p>As noted in the Introduction, WCAG 2 assumes the presence of a “user agent” such as a browser, media player, or assistive technology as a means to access web content. Many of the success criteria in WCAG 2 assume web content will be accessed by ICT where assistive technologies can be connected to it or installed on it. The assistive technologies then present the web content to people with disabilities in an accessible form. </p>
<p>ICT with <a href="#closed-functionality">closed functionality</a> does not allow the use of some assistive technologies for some or all of their functions. In many cases such ICT also lacks a “user agent” or its equivalent. To the extent the ICT is closed, following the WCAG success criteria by themselves will not make the software accessible. Where assistive technologies or user agents are not available to address the intent of these success criteria, something else needs to be provided or be required to facilitate accessibility as WCAG 2 intends. It is outside the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/wcag2ict/work-statement">WCAG2ICT Task Force Work Statement</a> to say what the additional measures are, but WCAG2ICT points out which success criteria depend on assistive technologies—and therefore would not work by themselves in a closed functionality context.</p>
<div class="example">
  
<p><span>Example: </span>In developing guidance for closed functionality, the task force has considered examples of ICT that historically have been partially or fully closed to assistive technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>self-service transaction machines or kiosks (e.g. retail self-checkout, point of sales (POS) terminals, and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs))</li>
<li>telephony devices (e.g. IP phones, feature phones, and smartphones)</li>
<li>entertainment technologies (e.g. smart TV, set-top box, smart watches)</li>
<li>ebook reader</li>
<li>computer that is locked down due to a policy so that users may not adjust settings or install software</li>
<li>other technology devices (e.g. printers, displays, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices).</li></ul></div>

<p>There are existing standards that provide accessibility requirements for both hardware and software aspects of closed functionality ICT. This document does not comment on those standards, but does note that WCAG success criteria should not be used as requirements for hardware aspects of closed functionality ICT. Instead, WCAG2ICT provides considerations for applying WCAG success criteria to software on closed functionality ICT. It also indicates where and why that might be problematic due to the underlying assumptions built into the WCAG success criteria. See <a href="#success-criteria-problematic-for-closed-functionality">Appendix A: Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality</a> for a list of success criteria for which this is relevant.</p>

<p>Text applications are a class of software ICT that appeared decades ago, prior to the emergence of the graphical user interface (GUI) and the Web. The interface of a text application is generated using only text characters, and either a hardware terminal or a software terminal application handles the rendering of the text application—similar to how a web user agent handles the rendering of a web application. Text applications only accept text input, though some may also support the use of a mouse or other input devices. More recently, terminal applications which render text applications in the GUI may utilize spoken input through Automated Speech Recognition (ASR). Both GUI and native text environment interfaces also now commonly support word-completion prediction technologies. Command-line applications are a subset of text applications with further specific properties.</p>
<p>Historically, assistive technologies developed alongside text applications, making it possible for text applications to be accessible. Although there are far fewer new text applications being developed compared to new GUI or web applications, text applications remain in use today. In fact, command-line interfaces have seen a resurgence in recent years, especially in popular programming and revision tracking environments with continued development and greater functionality. In some cases this has precipitated renewed developments in assistive technology support for text applications.</p>
<p>Assistive technology support continues to evolve in today's text applications. Key examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In command line interfaces (CLI), support often includes context-sensitive help, so that help output following one command argument is different from the help provided following two arguments, and different still after three arguments. This helps users be more efficient and places no new requirements on assistive technologies.</li>
<li>Output options generally include machine-readable structured text formats (such as JSON), in addition to the still powerful and widely used options of input/output redirection and piping. In these scenarios the assistive technology user can make use of the same range of output options as anyone else who finds the CLI environment compelling.</li>
</ul>
<p>As noted in <a href="#background-on-text-command-line-terminal-applications-and-interfaces">Appendix B. Background on Text / Command-line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces</a>, applying WCAG to text / command-line applications involves understanding how text applications are rendered, how text applications have been made accessible via assistive technologies, and how to apply the concepts of “accessibility supported” and “programmatically determined” to text applications.</p>

<p>WCAG2ICT is not a standard, so it is not possible to conform to WCAG2ICT. However, some entities may wish to use the information in WCAG2ICT to help establish standards or regulations regarding accessibility in ICT that are based on WCAG 2. While such standards or regulations will need to address matters of conformance themselves, the following notes may be of assistance to those wishing to draft their own requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The WCAG 2 success criteria and the conformance requirements were designed to work together, such that the language of the success criteria is based on the nature of the conformance requirements. The choice of what level to use for a given criteria (A vs. AA vs. AAA) was further influenced by a number of factors specific to the web domain, as set forth in <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#levels">Understanding Levels of Conformance</a>.</li>
<li>In the WCAG 2 conformance model, a <a href="#dfn-satisfies-a-success-criterion">success criteria is satisfied</a> if the item being evaluated does not fail it. If the success criterion is in relation to something that does not exist for the item being evaluated (e.g. a success criterion is about captioning audio and there is no audio), where some might consider the criterion "not applicable", the success criterion is automatically met. This approach is central to the way the success criteria in WCAG are structured and worded.</li>
<li>WCAG 2 conformance is applied to the item being evaluated (i.e. web page) as a whole, except when a process includes use of several items, in which case all of the items that are needed in order to complete the process must conform.</li>
<li>In WCAG 2, when conformance relies on accessibility features of the platform (i.e. browser for web content) or on assistive technologies, WCAG 2 requires that there are assistive technologies, etc. that work with the product (web page). That is, conformance with WCAG 2 requires that the approaches used are supported by assistive technologies.</li>
<li>WCAG 2 allows information on part of a page to not conform if the same information is available elsewhere on the page in conforming fashion. However WCAG 2 identifies 4 success criteria that must be met on all areas of the page because they can interfere with the user's ability to access and use other parts of the page:<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-control">1.4.2 Audio Control</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#no-keyboard-trap">2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#pause-stop-hide">2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#three-flashes-or-below-threshold">2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold</a>;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, as noted in the Introduction, it wasn't possible to unambiguously carve up software into discrete pieces, and so the unit of evaluation for non-web software is the whole software program. As with any software testing this can be a very large unit of evaluation, and methods similar to standard software testing might be used.</p>

A person who cannot  hear an audio file can have the text alternative displayed so that he or she can read  it. In the future, text alternatives will also allow information to be more easily  translated into sign language or into a simpler form of the same language.  </p><section>  <h3 id="111-non-text-content-note-on-captcha">Note on CAPTCHA</h3>  <p>  CAPTCHAs are a controversial topic in the accessibility community. As is described in the  paper <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a>, CAPTCHAs intrinsically push the edges of human abilities in an attempt to defeat  automated processes. Every type of CAPTCHA will be unsolvable by users with certain  disabilities. However, they are widely used, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  Working Group believes that if CAPTCHAs were forbidden outright, Web sites would choose  not to conform to WCAG rather than abandon CAPTCHA. This would create barriers for  a great many more users with disabilities. For this reason the Working Group has chosen  to structure the requirement about CAPTCHA in a way that meets the needs of most people  with disabilities, yet is also considered adoptable by sites. Requiring two different  forms of CAPTCHA on a given site ensures that most people with disabilities will find  a form they can use.  </p>  <p>Because some users with disabilities will still not be able to access sites that meet  the minimum requirements, the Working Group provides recommendations for additional  steps. Organizations motivated to conform to WCAG should be aware of the importance  of this topic and should go as far beyond the minimum requirements of the guidelines  as possible. Additional recommended steps include:  </p>  <ul>  <li>Providing more than two modalities of CAPTCHAs</li>  <li>Providing access to a human customer service representative who can bypass CAPTCHA</li>  <li>Not requiring CAPTCHAs for authorized users</li>  </ul>  </section><section>  <h3 id="111-non-text-content-additional-information">Additional information</h3>  <p>Non-text content can take a number of forms, and this Success Criterion specifies  how each is to be handled.  </p>  <p> <strong>  For non-text content that is not covered by one of the other situations listed below,  </strong>  such as charts, diagrams, audio recordings, pictures, and animations, text alternatives  can make the same information available in a form that can be rendered through any  modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile). Short and long text alternatives  can be used as needed to convey the information in the non-text content. Note that  <strong>  prerecorded  audio-only  </strong> and <strong> prerecorded  video-only  </strong> files are covered here. <strong>  Live-audio-only  </strong> and <strong>  Live-video-only  </strong> files are covered below (see 3rd paragraph following this one). </p>  <p> <strong>  For non-text content that is a control or accepts user input  </strong>, such as images used as submit buttons, image maps or complex animations, a name  is provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content so that the person at  least knows what the non-text content is and why it is there.  </p>  <p> <strong>  Non-text content that is time-based media  </strong>  is made accessible through <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/time-based-media">1.2: Time-Based Media</a>. However, it is important that users know what it is when they encounter it on a  page so they can decide what action if any they want to take with it. A text alternative  that describes the time-based media and/or gives its title is therefore provided.  </p>  <p> <strong>  For Live Audio-only and live video-only content  </strong>, it can be much more difficult to provide text alternatives that provide equivalent  information as live audio-only and live video-only content. For these types of non-text  content, text alternatives provide a descriptive label. </p>  <p> <strong>  Sometimes a test or exercise must be partially or completely presented in non-text  format.  </strong> Audio or visual information is provided that cannot be changed to text because the  test or exercise must be conducted using that sense. For example, a hearing test  would be invalid if a text alternative were provided. A visual skill development  exercise would similarly make no sense in text form. And a spelling test with text  alternatives would not be very effective. For these cases, text alternatives should  be provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content; of course, the text alternatives  would not provide the same information needed to pass the test. </p>  <p> <strong>  Sometimes content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience  </strong> that words cannot fully capture. Examples include a symphony performance, works of  visual art etc. For such content, text alternatives at least identify the non-text  content with a descriptive label and where possible, additional descriptive text.  If the reason for including the content in the page is known and can be described  it is helpful to include that information. </p>  <p> <strong>Sometimes there are non-text exercises that are used to prove you are human.</strong> To avoid spam robots and other software from gaining access to a site a device called  a CAPTCHA is used. These usually involve visual or auditory tasks that are beyond  the current capabilities of Web robots. Providing a text alternative to them would  however make them operable by Robots, thus defeating their purpose. In this case a  text alternative would describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA, and alternate forms using  different modalities would be provided to address the needs of people with different  disabilities.  </p>  <p> <strong>  Sometimes there is non-text content that really is not meant to be seen or understood  by the user.  </strong> Transparent images used to move text over on a page; an invisible image that is used  to track usage statistics; and a swirl in the corner that conveys no information but  just fills up a blank space to create an aesthetic effect are all examples of this.  Putting alternative text on such items just distracts people using screen readers  from the content on the page. Not marking the content in any way, though, leaves users  guessing what the non-text content is and what information they may have missed (even  though they have not missed anything in reality). This type of non-text content, therefore,  is marked or implemented in a way that assistive technologies (AT) will ignore it  and not present anything to the user.  </p>  </section></blockquote></section></section></section><section id="time-based-media"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x6-1-3-time-based-media">1.2 Time-based Media</h4><a class="self-link" href="#time-based-media" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.1.3"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Provide alternatives for time-based media.</p></blockquote>

This  Success Criterion describes two approaches, either of which can be used.  </p><p>One approach is to provide audio description of the video content. The audio description  augments the audio portion of the presentation with the information needed when the  video portion is not available.

Unlike  audio description, the description of the video portion is not constrained to just  the pauses in the existing dialogue. Full descriptions are provided of all visual  information, including visual context, actions and expressions of actors, and any  other visual material. In addition, non-speech sounds (laughter, off-screen voices,  etc.) are described, and transcripts of all dialogue are included.

For example, the presentation format changes when the content is read  by a screen reader or when a user style sheet is substituted for the style sheet provided  by the author.  </p><p>  Sighted users perceive structure and relationships through various visual cues  — headings are often in a larger, bold font separated from paragraphs by blank lines;  list items are preceded by a bullet and perhaps indented; paragraphs are separated  by a blank line; items that share a common characteristic are organized into tabular  rows and columns; form fields may be positioned as groups that share text labels;  a different background color may be used to indicate that several items are related  to each other; words that have special status are indicated by changing the font family  and /or bolding, italicizing, or underlining them; items that share a common characteristic  are organized into a table where the relationship of cells sharing the same row or  column and the relationship of each cell to its row and/or column header are necessary  for understanding; and so on. Having these structures and these relationships programmatically  determined or available in text ensures that information important for comprehension  will be perceivable to all.  </p><p>Auditory cues may be used as well. For example, a chime might indicate the beginning  of a new section; a change in voice pitch or speech rate may be used to emphasize  important information or to indicate quoted text; etc.  </p><p>  When such relationships are perceivable to one set of users, those relationships can  be made to be perceivable to all.

An on-line  catalog may indicate prices using a larger font colored red. A screen reader or person  who cannot perceive red, still has the information about the price as long as it is  preceded by the currency symbol.  </p><p>Some technologies do not provide a means to programmatically determine some types  of information and relationships.

Some websites and applications automatically set and restrict the screen to a particular display orientation and expect  that users will respond by rotating their device to match, but this can create problems. Some users have their devices mounted  in a fixed orientation (e.g. on the arm of a power wheelchair). Therefore, websites and applications need to support both orientations  by not restricting the orientation. Changes in content or functionality due to the size of display are not covered by this criterion which is focused on restrictions of orientation.</p><p>Historically, devices tended to have a fixed-orientation display, and all content was created to match that display orientation. Today, most handhelds and many other devices (e.g., monitors) have a hardware-level ability to dynamically adjust default display orientation based on sensor information. The goal of this Success Criterion is that authors should never restrict content's orientation, thus ensuring that it always match the device display orientation.</p><p>It is important to distinguish between an author's responsibility not to restrict content to a specific orientation, and device-specific settings governing the locking of display orientation.</p><p>Many hand-held devices offer a mechanical switch or a system setting (or both) to allow the user to lock the device display to a specific orientation. Where a user decides to lock their entire device to an orientation, all applications are expected to pick up that setting and to display content accordingly.</p><p>This Success Criterion complements device "lock orientation" settings. A web page that does not restrict its display orientation will always support the system-level orientation setting, since the system setting is picked up by the user agent. Alternatively, where a device-level orientation lock is not in place, the user agent should display the page according to the orientation of the device (either its default, or the current orientation determined by any device sensors).</p><p>The exception for things considered essential is aimed at situations where the content would only be understood in a particular orientation, or where the technology restricts the possible orientations.

The ability to programmatically declare the specific kind of data expected in a particular field makes filling out forms easier, especially for people with cognitive disabilities.</p><p>Appropriate visible labels and instruction can help users understand the purpose of form input fields, but users may benefit from having fields that collect specific types of information be rendered in an unambiguous, consistent, and possibly customized way for different modalities - either through defaults in their user agent, or through the aid of assistive technologies.</p><p>For some input fields, the type attribute already offers a way to broadly specify the intention of the input field, for example, input type="tel", input type="email", or input type="password". However, these are only very broad categories, describing the type of input, but not necessarily its purpose, especially as it relates to user-specific input fields. As an example, type="email" indicates that the field is for an e-mail address but does not clarify if the purpose is for entering the user's e-mail address or some other person's e-mail.</p><p>This success criterion defines the types of user interface component input purposes, found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes">Section 7 of the WCAG 2.1 Recommendation</a>, that must be programmatically identifiable. When these user input purposes are present, and if the technology supports doing so, the field purpose must be programmatically identifiable.</p><p>The HTML autocomplete attribute only accepts a certain number of specific well-defined fixed values. This allows a more fine-grained definition or identification of purpose than the type attribute, for example, by allowing the author to specify a specific type of name: Name (autocomplete="name”), Given Name (autocomplete="given-name”), Family Name (autocomplete="family-name”), as well as Username (autocomplete="username”), and Nickname (autocomplete="nickname”).</p><p>By adopting and repurposing this predefined taxonomy of definitions, user agents and assistive technologies can now present the purpose of the inputs to users in different modalities. For example, assistive technologies may display familiar icons next to input fields to help users who have difficulties reading. An icon of a birthday cake may be shown in front of an input field with autocomplete="bday", or the icon of a telephone in front of an input field with autocomplete="tel".</p><p>In addition to repurposing this taxonomy, when the autocomplete attribute technique is used to meet this Success Criterion, browsers and other user agents can suggest and 'autofill' the right content by autocompleting these fields based on past user input stored in the browser. By defining more granular definitions of common input purposes, for example “Birthday” (autocomplete=”bday”), browsers can store personalized values for each of these fields (the user's birthday date). The user is relieved of having to type the information and can instead confirm or, if needed, change the value of the field, a significant benefit for users with memory issues, dyslexia, and other disabilities. Because the autocomplete values are independent of language, users that may not be familiar with the text used to visually identify user input fields (the label) can still have that purpose consistently identified to them due to the fixed taxonomy of terms.</p><p>If an input field accepts two different types of input purpose (as in combined user name/user email fields) and the technology used does not allow multiple purpose values to be defined, it is valid to provide either one or the other value or leave out the designation of input purpose altogether.</p><p>When the user agent and assistive technology support for other metadata formats matures, metadata schemes like the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/adapt-symbols/">Personalization Semantics Content Module</a> may be used in addition or instead of the HTML autocomplete attribute to identify the purpose of input fields. They can also support automated adaptations that identify and match author-provided input labels to defined vocabularies or symbols that are used instead for labelling inputs.</p></blockquote></section></section></section><section id="distinguishable"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x6-1-5-distinguishable">1.4 Distinguishable</h4><a class="self-link" href="#distinguishable" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.1.5"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from  background.</p></blockquote>

If the information is conveyed through color differences  in an image (or other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color  deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with color through  another visual means ensures users who cannot see color can still perceive the information.  </p><p>Color is an important asset in design of Web content, enhancing its aesthetic appeal,  its usability, and its accessibility. However, some users have difficulty perceiving  color. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older  users do not see color well. In addition, people using limited-color or  monochrome displays and browsers will be unable to access information that is presented  only in color.  </p><p>Examples of information conveyed by color differences: “required fields are red",  “error is shown in red", and “Mary's sales are in red, Tom's are in blue". Examples  of indications of an action include: using color to indicate that a link will open  in a new window or that a database entry has been updated successfully. An example  of prompting a response would be: using highlighting on form fields to indicate that  a required field had been left blank.  </p><div class="note">  <p>This should not in any way discourage the use of color on a page, or even color coding if it is complemented by other visual indication.  </p>  </div><div class="note">   <p>If content is conveyed through the use of colors that differ not only in their hue,  but that also have a significant difference in lightness, then this counts as an additional  visual distinction, as long as the difference in relative luminance between the colors leads  to a contrast ratio of 3:1 or greater.  For example, a light green and a dark red differ <strong>both</strong> by color (hue)  <strong>and</strong> by lightness, so they would pass if the contrast ratio is at least 3:1.  Similarly, if content is distinguished by inverting an element's foreground and background colors,  this would pass (again, assuming that the foreground and background colors have a sufficient contrast).  </p>  <p>However, if content relies on the user's ability to accurately perceive or differentiate a particular color  an additional visual indicator will be required regardless of the contrast ratio between those colors. For example, knowing whether an outline is green for valid or red for invalid.  </p>   </div><div class="note">   <p>This criterion does not directly address the needs of users with assistive technologies.  It aims to ensure that sighted users who cannot distinguish between some colors can still  understand content.  How information is conveyed to assistive technology users is covered separately in other  criteria, including (but not limited to)  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a>,  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>, and  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>.  </p>  <p>Conversely, even if information that is conveyed by color differences is appropriately conveyed  to assistive technologies, it does not necessarily pass this criterion, as sighted users who cannot  distinguish between certain color may not necessarily be using any assistive technologies. This  criterion requires a visible alternative to color.  </p>   </div><div class="note">   <p>Most user agents provide users with a color-only cue that a link has been previously activated by them ("visited"). However, several technical constraints result in authors having very limited control over these color-only indications of visited links. The technical constraints are as follows:  </p><ol>  <li> User agents constrain the exposure of a link's visited state due to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Privacy_and_the_:visited_selector">privacy concerns</a>. Author queries to user agents will indicate all links have not been visited.  </li>  <li>  Any available information on the visited state of a link would be inaccurate since it is both user and browser-dependent. Even if an author could accurately get information on previously activated links by a certain user, the author would be constrained to the current browser's preserved history, and would be unable to determine if the user had visited the page using a different browser (or if the history was not preserved, either from cache clearing or use of private sessions).  </li>  <li>  Authors can <em>only</em> use color to modify the <code>:visited</code> CSS pseudoclass style. The technology constrains any non-color styling. Due to palette limitations, an author cannot use color alone to achieve 3:1 contrast between link and non-link text as well as between visited and unvisited links while also achieving 4.5:1 contrast for all link and non-link text.  </li>  <li>  Authors also cannot set the visited state of links. The anchor element does not include a "visited" attribute; therefore the author has no ability to alter the state through an attribute setting. As such, authors cannot achieve <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a> or  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a> in regard to visited links.  </li> </ol>  <p></p>   <p>For these reasons, setting or conveying a link's visited status is not an author responsibility. Where color alone distinguishes between visited and unvisited links, it does not result in a failure of this Success Criterion, even where the contrast between the two link colors is below 3:1. Note that authors must continue to ensure that all text links meet contrast minimums against the page background (SC 1.4.3).</p>  </div></blockquote></section></section><section id="audio-control"><div class="header-wrapper"><h5 id="x6-1-5-3-audio-control">1.4.2 Audio Control</h5><a class="self-link" href="#audio-control" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.1.5.3"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a <a>mechanism</a> is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio  volume independently from the overall system volume level.  </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's  ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether or not it is used  to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion.

</section><section><h5 id="intent-from-understanding-1.4.3-contrast--minimum-">Intent from Understanding 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</h5><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and  its background so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision (who do  not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). For people without color deficiencies,  hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading  performance (Knoblauch et al., 1991). Color deficiencies can affect luminance contrast  somewhat. Therefore, in the recommendation, the contrast is calculated in such a way  that color is not a key factor so that people who have a color vision deficit will  also have adequate contrast between the text and the background.  </p><p>Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded. For example, if random  words are used to create a background and the words could be rearranged or substituted  without changing meaning, then it would be decorative and would not need to meet this  criterion. </p><p>Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast.  The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower. This allows authors to  use a wider range of color choices for large text, which is helpful for design of  pages, particularly titles. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large  enough to require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the  Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress Guidelines for Large  Print under <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum#resources">Resources</a>). "18 point" and "bold" can both have different meanings in  different fonts but, except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since there  are so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a note regarding thin or unusual  fonts is included in the definition for <a>large-scale</a> text.  </p><div class="note">  <p>When evaluating this Success Criterion, the font size in points should be obtained  from the user agent or calculated on font metrics in the way that user agents do.  Point sizes are based on the CSS <code>pt</code> size as defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#reference-pixel">CSS3 Values</a>. The ratio between  sizes in points and CSS pixels is <code>1pt = 1.333px</code>, therefore <code>14pt</code>  and <code>18pt</code> are equivalent to approximately <code>18.5px</code> and <code>24px</code>.  </p>  <p>Because different image editing applications default to different pixel densities  (e.g., <code>72ppi</code> or <code>96ppi</code>), specifying point sizes for fonts from within an  image editing application can be unreliable when it comes to presenting text at a specific size.  When creating images of large-scale text, authors should ensure that the text in the  resulting image is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the  default size for body text. For example, for a <code>72ppi</code> image, an author would need  to use approximately 19pt and 24pt font sizes in order to successfully present images  of large-scale text to a user. </p>  <p>The 3:1 and 4.5:1 contrast ratios referenced in this Success Criterion are intended to be  treated as threshold values. When comparing the computed contrast ratio to the Success Criterion  ratio, the computed values should not be rounded (e.g., 4.499:1 would not meet the 4.5:1 threshold).</p>  </div><div class="note">  <p>Because authors do not have control over user settings for font smoothing/anti-aliasing, when evaluating this  Success Criterion, refer to the foreground and background colors obtained from the user agent, or the underlying  markup and stylesheets, rather than the text as presented on screen.</p>  <p>Due to anti-aliasing, particularly thin or unusual fonts may be rendered by user agents with a much fainter  color than the actual text color defined in the underlying CSS. This can lead to situations where text has  a contrast ratio that nominally passes the Success Criterion, but has a much lower contrast in practice.  In these cases, best practice would be for authors to choose a font with stronger/thicker lines,  or to aim for a foreground/background color combination that exceeds the normative requirements  of this Success Criterion.  </p>  </div><p>The contrast requirements for text also apply to images of text  (text that has been rendered into pixels and then stored in an image format) - see  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text">Success Criterion 1.4.5: Images of Text</a>.  </p><p>This requirement applies to situations in which images of text were intended to be  understood as text. Incidental text, such as in photographs that happen to include  a street sign, are not included. Nor is text that for some reason is designed to be  invisible to all viewers. Stylized text, such as in corporate logos, should be treated  in terms of its function on the page, which may or may not warrant including the content  in the text alternative. Corporate visual guidelines beyond logo and logotype are  not included in the exception.  </p><p>In this provision there is an exception that reads "that are part of a picture that  contains significant other visual content,". This exception is intended to separate  pictures that have text in them from images of text that are done to replace text  in order to get a particular look. </p><div class="note">  <p>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate. It is also  harder to change foreground and background contrast and color combinations for images  of text, which is necessary for some users. Therefore, we suggest using text wherever  possible, and when not, consider supplying an image of higher resolution.  </p>  </div><p>The minimum contrast Success Criterion (1.4.3) applies to text in the page, including  placeholder text and text that is shown when a pointer is hovering over an object  or when an object has keyboard focus. If any of these are used in a page, the text  needs to provide sufficient contrast.  </p><p>Although this Success Criterion only applies to text, similar issues occur for content presented  in charts, graphs, diagrams, and other non-text-based information, which is covered by  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast">Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast</a>. </p><p>See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-enhanced">1.4.6: Contrast (Enhanced)</a>.  </p><section>  <h3 id="143-contrast-minimum-rationale-for-the-ratios-chosen">Rationale for the Ratios Chosen</h3>  <p>A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]]  for standard text and vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in this provision to account  for the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity, congenital  or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast sensitivity that typically  accompanies aging.  </p>  <p>The rationale is based on a) adoption of the 3:1 contrast ratio for minimum acceptable  contrast for normal observers, in the ANSI standard, and b) the empirical finding  that in the population, visual acuity of 20/40 is associated with a contrast sensitivity  loss of roughly 1.5 [[ARDITI-FAYE]]. A user with 20/40 would thus require a contrast ratio of  <code>3 * 1.5 = 4.5 to 1</code>. Following analogous empirical findings and the same logic,  the user with 20/80 visual acuity would require contrast of about 7:1.  </p>   <p>Hues are perceived differently by users with color vision deficiencies (both congenital  and acquired) resulting in different colors and relative luminance contrasts than  for normally sighted users. Because of this, effective contrast and readability are  different for this population. However, color deficiencies are so diverse that prescribing  effective general use color pairs (for contrast) based on quantitative data is not  feasible. Requiring good luminance contrast accommodates this by requiring contrast  that is independent of color perception. Fortunately, most of the luminance contribution  is from the mid and long wave receptors which largely overlap in their spectral responses.  The result is that effective luminance contrast can generally be computed without  regard to specific color deficiency, except for the use of predominantly long wavelength  colors against darker colors (generally appearing black) for those who have protanopia.  (We provide an advisory technique on avoiding red on black for that reason). For more  information see [[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1994]] [[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1996]] [[ARDITI]].  </p>  <div class="note">  <p>Some people with cognitive disabilities require color combinations or hues that have  low contrast, and therefore we allow and encourage authors to provide mechanisms to  adjust the foreground and background colors of the content. Some of the combinations  that could be chosen may have contrast levels that will be lower than those those  specified here. This is not a violation of this Success Criterion, provided  there is a mechanism that will return to the required values set out here.  </p> </div>  <p>The contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was chosen for level AA because it compensated for the  loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent  to approximately 20/40 vision. (20/40 calculates to approximately 4.5:1.) 20/40 is  commonly reported as typical visual acuity of elders at roughly age 80. [[GITTINGS-FOZARD]] </p>  <p>The contrast ratio of 7:1 was chosen for level AAA because it compensated for the  loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent  to approximately 20/80 vision. People with more than this degree of vision loss usually  use assistive technologies to access their content (and the assistive technologies  usually have contrast enhancing, as well as magnification capability built into them).  The 7:1 level therefore generally provides compensation for the loss in contrast sensitivity  experienced by users with low vision who do not use assistive technology and provides  contrast enhancement for color deficiency as well.  </p>  <div class="note">  <p>Calculations in [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]] are for body text.

The author's responsibility is to create Web  content that does not prevent the user agent from scaling the content effectively.  Authors may satisfy this Success Criterion by verifying that content does not interfere  with user agent support for resizing text, including text-based controls, or by providing  direct support for resizing text or changing the layout. An example of direct support  might be via server-side script that can be used to assign different style sheets.  </p><p>The author cannot rely on the user agent to satisfy this Success Criterion for HTML  content if users do not have access to a user agent with zoom support. For example,  if they work in an environment that requires them to use IE 6.  </p><p>If the author is using a technology whose user agents do not provide zoom support,  the author is responsible to provide this type of functionality directly or to provide  content that works with the type of functionality provided by the user agent. If the  user agent doesn't provide zoom functionality but does let the user change the  text size, the author is responsible for ensuring that the content remains usable  when the text is resized. </p><p>Some user interface components that function as a label and require activation by  the user to access content are not wide enough to accommodate the label's content.  For example, in Web mail applications the subject column may not be wide enough to  accommodate every possible subject header, but activating the subject header takes  the user to the full message with the full subject header. In Web-based spreadsheets,  cell content that is too long to be displayed in a column can be truncated, and the  full content of the cell is available to the user when the cell receives focus. The  content of a user interface component may also become too wide in user interfaces  where the user can resize the column width. In this type of user interface component,  line wrapping is not required; truncation is acceptable if the component's full content  is available on focus or after user activation and an indication that this information  can be accessed, is provided to the user in some way besides the fact that it is truncated.  </p><p>Content satisfies the Success Criterion if it can be scaled up to 200%, that is, up  to twice the width and height. Authors may support scaling beyond that limit, however,  as scaling becomes more extreme, adaptive layouts may introduce usability problems.  For example, words may be too wide to fit into the horizontal space available to them,  causing them to be truncated; layout constraints may cause text to overlap with other  content when it is scaled larger; or only one word of a sentence may fit on each line,  causing the sentence to be displayed as a vertical column of text that is difficult  to read. </p><p>The working group feels that 200% is a reasonable accommodation that can support a  wide range of designs and layouts, and complements older screen magnifiers that provide  a minimum magnification of 200%. Above 200%, zoom (which resizes text, images, and  layout regions and creates a larger canvas that may require both horizontal and vertical  scrolling) may be more effective than text resizing. Assistive technology dedicated  to zoom support would usually be used in such a situation and may provide better accessibility  than attempts by the author to support the user directly.  </p><div class="note">  <p>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate, and therefore  we suggest using text wherever possible. It is also harder to change foreground and  background contrast and color combinations for images of text, which are necessary  for some users.  </p>  </div><p>See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/visual-presentation">1.4.3: Visual Presentation</a>.  </p></blockquote></section></section><section id="images-of-text"><div class="header-wrapper"><h5 id="x6-1-5-6-images-of-text">1.4.5 Images of Text</h5><a class="self-link" href="#images-of-text" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.1.5.6"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, <a>text</a> is used to convey information rather than <a>images of text</a> except for the following:  </p><dl xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">  <dt>Customizable</dt>  <dd>  <p>The image of text can be <a>visually customized</a> to the user's requirements;  </p>  </dd>  <dt>Essential</dt>  <dd>  <p>A particular presentation of text is <a>essential</a> to the information being conveyed.  </p>  </dd>  </dl><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.</p></blockquote>

When the browser zoom is used to scale content to 400%, it reflows - i.e., it is presented in one column so that scrolling in more than one direction is not necessary.</p><p>For people with low vision, enlarged text with reflow enables reading. It is critical. Enlargement enables perception of characters. Reflow enables tracking. Tracking is following along lines of text, including getting from the end of one line to the beginning of the next line.</p><p>Avoiding the need to scroll in the direction of reading in order to reveal lines that are cut off by the viewport is important, because such scrolling significantly increases the effort required to read. It is also important that content is not hidden off-screen. For example, zooming into a vertically scrolling page should not cause content to be hidden to one side.</p><section>  <h3 id="1410-reflow-how-reflow-works">How reflow works</h3>  <p>User agents for technologies such as HTML/CSS, PDF, and ePub have methods for reflowing content to fit the width of the window (viewport). When appropriately authored, page content can reflow (wrap) to stay within the window's boundaries (viewport) when users zoom in to enlarge the size of content. Spatial relationships of content may change when users zoom, but all information and functionality should continue to be available.</p>  <p>Supporting the reflow of content is also known as 'Responsive Web Design'. It is enabled by CSS media queries which reformat the web content for different viewport widths (at particular break points) in order to provide optimised layouts for mobile devices such as tablets or smartphones. Importantly, these breakpoints are not only triggered by narrower viewports, but also when users employ the browser zoom function to zoom into the page.</p>  <p>In a desktop browser at 100% (default) scale, typical web pages that support reflow display content in two, three or more columns. Zooming in will at some point trigger a change of layout, so content will now be displayed in fewer columns. At a higher magnification scale of 200% or more, content will usually be rendered in a single column. Parts of content that were in the marginal columns, like a navigation menu or supplementary content, will now typically appear on top of or below the main content.</p>  </section><section>  <h3 id="1410-reflow-viewing-distance-and-display-resolution">Viewing distance and display resolution</h3>  <p>The value of 320 CSS pixels was chosen as a reasonable minimum size that authors can achieve. This value lines up with the reported viewport width of small displays of common mobile devices. The width of 320 CSS pixels exactly corresponds to a desktop browser window set to a width of 1280px and zoomed in to 400%. It should be noted that 400% applies to the dimension, not the area. It means four times the default width and four times the default height.</p> <figure id="figure-CSS-pixel-letter-4x"><img src="img/css-pixel-by-device.png" width="462" height="198" alt="Diagram showing the size of character needed by viewing distance to make the same image on the retina with small screen devices close, large screen devices further away.">  <figcaption>A letter of the same CSS pixel size on different displays with different resolutions</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>When we read, the size of the print is not as important as the image it projects on the retina of our eye. Phones are designed for close viewing while desktops are designed for viewing farther away. As a consequence 16px print on a phone is physically smaller than 16px print on a desktop. This is not a problem because both print sizes cast the same image on our retina if they are viewed at their intended distance.</p>  </section><section>  <h3 id="1410-reflow-visibility-and-availability-of-content">Visibility and availability of content</h3> <p>How much of the content is visible may change at different scales. For example, navigation menus that are fully visible in the desktop layout are often collapsed into fewer items, or even into a single menu button (the 'hamburger' icon pattern) so they take up less screen space.</p>  <p>The Success Criterion is met as long as all content and functionality are still fully available - either directly, or revealed via accessible controls, or accessible via direct links.</p>  </section><section>   <h3 id="1410-reflow-content-exceptions-for-reflow">Content exceptions for reflow</h3>  <p>Content which requires two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning cannot reflow without loss of meaning, and is therefore excepted from the need to be presented without two-dimensional scrolling. For example, graphics and video are by their nature two-dimensional. Cutting up an image and stacking the blocks would render the content unusable. However, it <em>is</em> possible to have these elements stay within the bounds of viewport even as other content zooms to 400% (see advisory techniques).</p>  <p>Data tables have a two-dimensional relationship between the headings and data cells. This relationship is essential to convey the content. This Success Criterion therefore exempts data tables from needing to display without scrolling in the direction of text (e.g., horizontally in a vertically scrolling page). However, cells within data tables are not excepted unless the cell contains types of content that also requires two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.</p>  <p>Interfaces which provide toolbars to edit content need to show both the content and the toolbar in the viewport. Depending on the number of toolbar buttons, the toolbar may need to scroll in the direction of text.</p>  </section><section>  <h3 id="1410-reflow-responsive-web-design-and-other-ways-to-meet-this-success-criterion">Responsive web design and other ways to meet this Success Criterion</h3>  <p>Using the responsive web design approach is the most effective method of achieving the goal of allowing people to zoom in to 400%. Each variation (CSS break point) of the page at the same URL should conform (compare <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#h-note-27">Conformance for WCAG 2.1</a>).</p>  <p>For organisations which are using legacy systems or are not able to update their layout methods for some reason, an alternative conforming version could be a mobile site which has a fixed 320px wide layout. The user should be able to find that version from the default website.</p>  </section><section>  <h3 id="1410-reflow-avoiding-scrolling-in-horizontally-and-vertically-written-languages">Avoiding scrolling in horizontally and vertically written languages</h3>  <p>The success Criterion applies to both horizontally and vertically written languages. Zooming the page for horizontally written languages where pages scroll vertically by default (e.g. English) should not require horizontal scrolling. Zooming the page for vertically written languages which scroll horizontally by default should not require vertical scrolling.</p>  </section><section>  <h3 id="1410-reflow-the-relation-of-reflow-to-the-success-criterion-144-resize-text">The relation of Reflow to the Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text</h3>  <p>The focus of the Reflow Success Criterion is to enable users to zoom in without having to scroll in two directions. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text" class="sc">Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text</a> also applies, so it should be possible to increase the size of all text to at least 200% while simultaneously meeting the reflow requirement. For most implementations, the text is expected to continue to enlarge as the magnification increases, so that users can magnify text up to (and beyond) 400%. In an implementation where text does not consistently increase its size as people zoom in (such as when it is transformed based on a media query to adapt to small-screen usage), it must still be possible to get to 200% enlargement in order to satisfy the Resize Text criterion.</p>  <p>For example, if at the default browser setting of 100% zoom, text is set at 20px when the window is 1280px wide, the same 20px at 200% zoom would mean a text size of 200%. At 400% zoom, the author may decide to set the text size to 10px: the text would now still be enlarged to 200% compared to the default browser setting of 100% zoom. It is not required to achieve 200% text enlargement at every breakpoint, but it should be possible to get 200% text enlargement in some way.</p>  </section><section>  <h3 id="1410-reflow-browsers-on-mobile-operating-systems">Browsers on mobile operating systems</h3>  <p>Most browsers on mobile operating systems do not combine reflow and zoom in the same way as on desktop browsers. These mobile browsers normally support reflow when changing the orientation of the device -- content will be adjusted to the new viewport width. However, these mobile browsers can only magnify content to achieve 1.4.4. Resize Text in manners which do not constrain reflow to a single dimension, for example by using a pinch gesture to scale up content or a double tap on a particular column to make it fill the viewport width. This means that zoomed content in most mobile browsers involves two-dimensional scrolling regardless of what an author does.</p>  <p>Mobile user agents <em>can</em> offer reflow when users zoom into content, as evidenced by the Dolphin browser for Android. The lack of magnified reflow support in browsers on mobile operating systems can therefore be regarded as a user agent support issue.</p>  </section></blockquote></section></section><section id="non-text-contrast"><div class="header-wrapper"><h5 id="x6-1-5-8-non-text-contrast">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</h5><a class="self-link" href="#non-text-contrast" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.1.5.8"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The visual <a>presentation</a> of the following have a <a>contrast ratio</a> of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):</p><dl xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">  <dt>User Interface Components</dt>  <dd>Visual information required to identify <a>user interface components</a> and <a>states</a>, except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author;</dd>  <dt>Graphical Objects</dt>  <dd>Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is <a>essential</a> to the information being conveyed.</dd>  </dl></blockquote>

The requirements and rationale are similar to those for large text in <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>.</p><p>Low contrast controls are more difficult to perceive, and may be completely missed by people with a visual impairment. Similarly, if a graphic is needed to understand the content or functionality of the webpage then it should be perceivable by people with low vision or other impairments without the need for contrast-enhancing assistive technology.</p><div class="note">  <p>The 3:1 contrast ratios referenced in this Success Criterion is intended to be treated as threshold values. When comparing the computed contrast ratio to the Success Criterion ratio, the computed values should not be rounded (e.g. 2.999:1 would not meet the 3:1 threshold).</p>  </div><section id="1411-non-text-contrast-section-user-interface-components">  <h3 id="1411-non-text-contrast-active-user-interface-components">Active User Interface Components</h3>   <p>For active controls any visual information provided that is necessary for a user to identify that a control is present and how to operate it must have a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio with the adjacent colors. Also, any visual information necessary to indicate state, such as whether a component is selected or focused must also ensure that the information used to identify the control in that state has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio.</p>  <p>This Success Criterion does not require that changes in color that differentiate between states of an individual component meet the 3:1 contrast ratio when they do not appear next to each other. For example, there is not a new requirement that visited links contrast with the default color, or that mouse hover indicators contrast with the default state. However, the component must not lose contrast with the adjacent colors, and non-text indicators such as the check in a checkbox, or an arrow graphic indicating a menu is selected or open must have sufficient contrast to the adjacent colors.</p>   <h4 id="1411-non-text-contrast-boundaries">Boundaries</h4>  <p>This success criterion does not require that controls have a visual boundary indicating the hit area, but if the visual indicator of the control is the only way to identify the control, then that indicator must have sufficient contrast. If text (or an icon) within a button or placeholder text inside a text input is visible and there is no visual indication of the hit area then the Success Criterion is passed. If a button with text also has a colored border, since the border does not provide the only indication there is no contrast requirement beyond the text contrast (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>). Note that for people with cognitive disabilities it is recommended to delineate the boundary of controls to aid in the recognition of controls and therefore the completion of activities.</p>  <figure id="figure-buttons-no-visual-indicator">  <img alt="Two buttons, the first with no visual indicator except text saying 'button'.

For example, if an input has a white internal background, dark border, and white external background the 'adjacent color' to the component would be the white external background.</p>  <figure id="figure-standard-text-adjacent-white">  <img src="img/text-input-default.png" alt="Standard text input with a label, white internal and external background with a dark border.">  <figcaption>A standard text input with a grey border (#767676) and white adjacent color outside the component</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>If components use several colors, any color which does not interfere with identifying the component can be ignored for the purpose of measuring contrast ratio. For example, a 3D drop-shadow on an input, or a dark border line between contrasting backgrounds is considered to be subsumed into the color closest in brightness (perceived luminance).</p>   <p>The following example shows an input that has a light background on the inside and a dark background around it. The input also has a dark grey border which is considered to be subsumed into the dark background. The border does not interfere with identifying the component, so the contrast ratio is taken between the white background and dark blue background.</p>   <figure id="figure-text-box-dark-bg-light-border">  <img alt="A text box with a dark background and light border, with a white background." src="img/text-input-background-border.png">  <figcaption> The contrast of the input background (white) and color adjacent to the control (dark blue #003366) is sufficient.

The principle is that contrast ratio (the difference in brightness) can be used to distinguish text or graphics. For example, <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G183.html">G183</a> is a technique to use a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text to distinguish links and controls. In that case the Working Group regards a link color that meets the 3:1 contrast ratio relative to the non-linked text color as satisfying the Success Criterion <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color">1.4.1 Use of color</a> since it is relying on contrast ratio as well as color (hue) to convey that the text is a link.</p>   <p>Non-text information within controls that uses a change of hue alone to convey the value or state of an input, such as a 1-5 star indicator with a black outline for each star filled with either yellow (full) or white (empty) is likely to fail the Use of color criterion rather than this one.</p>   <figure id="figure-two-star-ratings">  <img src="img/star-examples-pass.png" alt="Two star ratings, one uses a black outline (on white) with a black fill to indicate it is checked.

In the context of graphics contrast, each item within such an infographic should be treated as a set of graphical objects, regardless of whether it is in one file or separate files.</p>   <p>Infographics often fail to meet several WCAG level AA criteria including:</p>   <ul>  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content.html">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color.html">1.4.1 Use of Color</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html">1.4.3 (Text) Contrast</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text.html">1.4.5 Images of Text</a></li>  </ul>   <p>An infographic can use text which meets the other criteria to minimise the number of graphical objects required for understanding. For example, using text with sufficient contrast to provide the values in a chart.

<p>"Content implemented using markup languages" includes parts of software that use markup internally to define a user interface. Examples of markup languages that are used internally to define a software user interface include but are not limited to: HTML (e.g., in <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> applications or iOS application Web views), XAML, XML (e.g., in Android application layouts), and XUL.</p></div></div><p></p>

<p>There are several mechanisms that allow users to modify text spacing properties of content implemented in markup languages. For example, an eBook technology may have an available user agent that allows users to override document text styles, or a software application may provide a "user style sheet" facility to modify the appearance of the software's own user interface. This Success Criterion does not require that documents and software implement their own mechanisms to allow users to set text spacing; however, when such a mechanism is available, the Success Criterion requires that content respond appropriately to it.</p></div></div><p></p>
</section><section><h5 id="intent-from-understanding-1.4.12-text-spacing">Intent from Understanding 1.4.12 Text Spacing</h5><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p>The intent of this Success Criterion (SC) is to ensure that when people override author specified text spacing to improve their reading experience, content is still readable and operable. Each of the requirements stipulated in the SC's four bullets helps ensure text styling can be adapted by the user to suit their needs.</p><p>The specified metrics set a minimum baseline. The values in between the author's metrics and the metrics specified in this SC should not have loss of content or functionality.</p><p>This SC focuses on the adaptability of content to an increase in spacing between lines, words, letters, and paragraphs. Any combination of these may assist a user with effectively reading text. As well, ensuring that content correctly adapts when users override author settings for spacing also significantly increases the likelihood other style preferences can be set by the user. For example, a user may need to change to a wider font family than the author has set in order to effectively read text. </p><section>  <h3 id="authorresp">Author Responsibility</h3>  <p>This SC does not dictate that authors must set all their content to the specified metrics. Rather, it specifies that an author's content has the ability to be set to those metrics without loss of content or functionality. The author requirement is both to not interfere with a user's ability to override the author settings, and to ensure that content thus modified does not break content in the manners shown in figures 1 through 3 in Effects of Not Allowing for Spacing Override. The values in the SC are a baseline. Authors are encouraged to surpass the values specified, not see them as a ceiling to build to. If the user chooses to go beyond the metrics specified any resulting loss of content or functionality is the user's responsibility.</p>  <p>Further, this SC is not concerned with <em>how</em> users change the line height and spacing metrics. It does not require that content implement its own mechanisms to allow users to do this. It is not a failure of the content if a user agent or platform does not provide a way for users to do this. Content does not fail this SC if the method chosen by the user - for instance, the use of an extension or bookmarklet - fails to correctly set the line height and spacing text properties on the content (provided that the content is not actively and purposely preventing the properties from being added).</p>  <section>  <h4 id="applicability">Applicability</h4>  <p>If the markup-based technologies being used are capable of overriding text to the Success Criterion's metrics, then this SC is applicable. For instance Cascading Style Sheet/HTML technologies are quite able to allow for the specified spacing metrics. Plugin technologies would need to have a built-in ability to modify styles to the specified metrics. Currently, this SC does not apply to PDF as it is not implemented using markup.</p>  <p>Examples of text that are typically not affected by <a>style properties</a> and not expected to adapt are:</p>  <ul>  <li>Video captions embedded directly into the video frames and not provided as an associated caption file</li>  <li><a>Images of text</a></li>  </ul>  <p>For this SC, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#the-canvas-element">canvas</a> implementations of text are considered to be <a>images of text</a>.</p>  </section>  <section>  <h4 id="ellipses">Use of ellipses</h4>  <p>There may be regions of a page where text containers cannot expand due to design constraints (such as a maximum width for the left navigation or table column headers). A common convention if text exceeds its space is to replace truncated text with an ellipsis. Where ellipses appear as a result of modifying text style properties, the page can still meet the Text Spacing requirements, so long as the content is still available. For example:</p>  <ul>  <li>a mechanism is provided to reveal the truncated text on the page (for instance, the text appears on focus or on activation)</li>  <li>where the ellipsis is part of a section of content which includes a link, the truncated text is revealed on the linked page</li>  </ul>  <p>Where text is not truncated but it is when text is spaced, if there is no mechanism to show the truncated text, it fails this Success Criterion.</p>  </section>  </section><section>  <h3 id="userresp">User Responsibility</h3>  <p>The ability to read and derive meaning from the overridden spacing rests with the user. The user may choose to exceed the spacing adjustments in the SC. If the increased spacing causes loss of content or functionality, the user will adjust or return to the author’s original spacing or spacing within the bounds of the SC. Regardless, the user needs the flexibility to adjust spacing within the bounds set in the SC without loss of content or functionality. Such changes may be achieved via user stylesheet, bookmarklet, extension, or application.</p>  </section><section>  <h3 id="effects-not-allowing">Effects of Not Allowing for Spacing Override</h3>  <p>The following images show some types of failures when authors do not take into consideration that users may override spacing to the metrics specified in this Success Criterion.</p>  <section>  <h4 id="cutoff">Text Cut Off</h4>  <p>The bottom portion of the words "Your Needs" is cut off in a heading making that text unreadable in Figure 1.

Reasons for such issues include:</p><ol>  <li>the user may not have intended to trigger the interaction</li>  <li>the user may not know new content has appeared</li>  <li>the new content may intefere with a user's ability to do a task</li>  </ol><p>Examples of such interactions can include custom tooltips, sub-menus and other nonmodal popups which display on hover and focus. The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that authors who cause additional content to appear and disappear in this manner must design the interaction in such a way that users can:</p><ul>  <li>perceive the additional content AND</li>  <li>dismiss it without disrupting their page experience.</li>  </ul><p>There are usually more predictable and accessible means of adding content to the page, which authors are recommended to employ. If an author <em>does</em> choose to make additional content appear and disappear in coordination with hover and keyboard focus, this success criterion specifies three conditions that must be met:</p><ul>  <li>dismissable</li>  <li>hoverable</li>  <li>persistent</li>  </ul><p>Each of these is discussed in a separate section.</p><section>  <h3 id="1413-content-on-hover-or-focus-dismissable">Dismissable</h3>  <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure that the additional content does not interfere with viewing or operating the page's original content. When magnified, the portion of the page visible in the viewport can be significantly reduced. Mouse users frequently move the pointer to pan the magnified viewport and display another portion of the screen. However, almost the entire portion of the page visible in this restricted viewport may trigger the additional content, making it difficult for a user to pan without re-triggering the content. A keyboard means of dismissing the additional content provides a workaround.</p>  <p>Alternatively, low vision users who can only navigate via the keyboard do not want the small area of their magnified viewport cluttered with hover text. They need a keyboard method of dismissing something that is obscuring the current focal area.</p>  <p>Two methods may be used to satisfy this condition and prevent such interference:</p>  <ol>  <li>Position the additional content so that it does not obscure any other content including the trigger, with the exception of white space and purely decorative content, such as a background graphic which provides no information.</li>  <li>Provide a mechanism to easily dismiss the additional content, such as by pressing Escape.</li>  </ol>  <p>For most triggers of relatively small size, it is desirable for both methods to be implemented. If the trigger is large, noticing the additional content may be of concern if it appears away from the trigger. In those cases, only the second method may be appropriate.</p>  <p>The success criterion allows for input error messages to persist as there are cases that require attention, explicit confirmation or remedial action.</p>  </section><section>  <h3 id="1413-content-on-hover-or-focus-hoverable">Hoverable</h3>  <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure that additional content which may appear on hover of a target may also be hovered itself. Content which appears on hover can be difficult or impossible to perceive if a user is required to keep their mouse pointer over the trigger. When the added content is large, magnified views may mean that the user needs to scroll or pan to completely view it, which is impossible unless the user is able to move their pointer off the trigger without the additional content disappearing.</p>  <p>Another common situation is when large pointers have been selected via platform settings or assistive technology. Here, the pointer can obscure a significant area of the additional content. A technique to view the content fully in both situations is to move the mouse pointer directly from the trigger onto the new content. This capability also offers significant advantages for users who utilize screen reader feedback on mouse interactions. This condition generally implies that the additional content overlaps or is positioned adjacent to the target.</p>  </section><section>  <h3 id="1413-content-on-hover-or-focus-persistent">Persistent</h3>  <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure users have adequate time to perceive the additional content after it becomes visible. Users with disabilities may require more time for many reasons, such as to change magnification, move the pointer, or simply to bring the new content into their visual field. Once it appears, the content should remain visible until:</p>  <ul>  <li>The user removes hover or focus from the trigger and the additional content, consistent with the typical user experience;</li>  <li>The user dismisses the additional content via the mechanism provided to satisfy the Dismissable condition; or</li>  <li>The information conveyed by the additional content becomes invalid, such as a 'busy' message that is no longer valid.</li>  </ul>  </section><section>  <h3 id="1413-content-on-hover-or-focus-additional-notes">Additional Notes</h3>  <ul>  <li>This criterion does not attempt to solve such issues when the appearance of the additional content is completely controlled by the user agent.

</section><section><h5 id="intent-from-understanding-2.1.4-character-key-shortcuts">Intent from Understanding 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts</h5><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p>The intent of this Success Crition is to reduce accidental activation of keyboard shortcuts. Character key shortcuts work well for many keyboard users, but are inappropriate and frustrating for speech input users — whose means of input is strings of letters — and for keyboard users who are prone to accidentally hit keys. To rectify this issue, authors need to allow users to turn off or reconfigure shortcuts that are made up of only character keys. </p><p>Note that this success criterion doesn't affect components such as listboxes and drop-down menus. Although these components contain values (words) that may be selected by one or more character keys, the shortcuts are only active when the components have focus. Other components such as menus may be accessed or opened with a single non-character shortcut (e.g., Alt or Alt+F) before pressing a single character key to select an item. This makes the full path to invoking a menu a two-step shortcut that includes a non-printable key. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/single-page.html#the-accesskey-attribute">Accesskeys</a>&nbsp;are also not affected because they include modifier keys.</p><p>Speech Input users generally work in a single mode where they can use a mix of dictation and speech commands. This works well because the user knows to pause before and after commands, and commands are usually at least two words long. So, for instance, a user might say a bit of dictation, such as "the small boat", then pause, and say a command to delete that dictation, such as "Delete Line". In contrast, if the user were to say the two phrases together without a pause, the whole phrase would come out as dictation (i.e., "the small boat delete line"). Although speech input programs often include modes that listen only for dictation or only for commands, most speech users use the all-encompassing mode all the time because it is a much more efficient workflow. It could decrease command efficiency significantly if users were to change to command mode and back before and after issuing each command.</p><p>Speech users can also speak most keyboard commands (e.g., "press Control Foxtrot") without any problems. If the website or app is keyboard enabled, the speech user can also write a native speech macro that calls the keyboard command, such as "This Print" to carry out Ctrl+P.</p><p>Single-key shortcuts are the exception. While using single letter keys as controls might be appropriate and efficient for many keyboard users, single-key shortcuts are disastrous for speech users. The reason for this is that when only a single key is used to trip a command, a spoken word can become a barrage of single-key commands if the cursor focus happens to be in the wrong place.</p><p>For example, a speech-input user named Kim has her cursor focus in the main window of a web mail application that uses common keyboard shortcuts to navigate ("k"), archive ("y") and mute messages ("m"). A coworker named Mike enters her office and says "Hey Kim" and her microphone picks that up. The Y of "hey" archives the current message. K in "Kim" moves down one conversation and M mutes a message or thread. And, if Kim looks up and says "Hey Mike" without remembering to turn off the microphone, the same three things happen in a different sequence.</p><p>A user interacting with a webpage or web app that doesn't use single-character shortcuts doesn't have this problem. Inadvertent strings of characters from the speech application are not interpreted as shortcuts if a modifier key is required. A speech user filling in a text input form may find that a phrase that is accidentally picked up by the speech microphone results in stray text being entered into the field, but that is easily seen and undone. The Resources section of this page contains links to videos demonstrating these types of issues.</p><section id="214-character-key-shortcuts-section-benefits">  <h3 id="214-character-key-shortcuts-benefits">Benefits</h3>  <ul>  <li>Speech users will be able to turn off single-key shortcuts so they can avoid accidentally firing batches of them at once. This will allow speech users to make full use of programs that offer single-key shortcuts to keyboard users.</li>  <li>Keyboard-only users who have dexterity challenges can also be prone to accidentally hitting keys. Those users would be able to avoid problematic single character shortcuts by turning them off or modifying them to include at least one non-character key.</li>  <li>Allowing <em>all</em> shortcut keys to be remapped can help users with some cognitive disabilities, since the same shortcuts can be assigned to perform the same actions across different applications.</li>  </ul>  </section></blockquote></section></section></section><section id="enough-time"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x6-2-3-enough-time">2.2 Enough Time</h4><a class="self-link" href="#enough-time" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.2.3"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Provide users enough time to read and use content.</p></blockquote>

People with disabilities  such as blindness, low vision, dexterity impairments, and cognitive limitations may  require more time to read content or to perform functions such as filling out on-line  forms. If Web functions are time-dependent, it will be difficult for some users to  perform the required action before a time limit occurs. This may render the service  inaccessible to them. Designing functions that are not time-dependent will help people  with disabilities succeed at completing these functions. Providing options to disable  time limits, customize the length of time limits, or request more time before a time  limit occurs helps those users who require more time than expected to successfully  complete tasks.

For example, if a time limit is included in order to address security concerns, it  would be considered to have been set by the content because it is designed to be  part of the presentation and interaction experience for that content. Time limits  set externally to content, such as by the user agent or by factors intrinsic to the  Internet are not under the author's control and not subject to WCAG conformance requirements.  Time limits set by Web servers should be under the author's/organization's control  and are covered.

Some would fail, but some would fail all lengths of time. A reasonable period for  requesting more time is required since an arbitrarily long time can provide security  risks to all users, including those with disabilities, for some applications. For  example, with kiosks or terminals that are used for financial transactions, it is  quite common for people to walk away without signing off. This leaves them vulnerable  to those walking up behind them. Providing a long period of inactivity before asking,  and then providing a long period for the person to indicate that they are present  can leave terminals open for abuse. If there is no activity the system should ask  if the user is there.

<section><h5 id="intent-from-understanding-2.3.1-three-flashes-or-below-threshold">Intent from Understanding 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold</h5><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow users to access the full content  of a site without inducing seizures due to photosensitivity.  </p><p>Individuals who have photosensitive seizure disorders can have a seizure triggered  by content that flashes at certain frequencies for more than a few flashes. People  are even more sensitive to red flashing than to other colors, so a special test is  provided for saturated red flashing. These guidelines were originally based on guidelines for  the broadcasting industry as adapted for desktop monitors, where content is viewed  from a closer distance (using a larger angle of vision).  </p><p>Flashing can be caused by the display, the computer rendering the image or by the  content being rendered. The author has no control of the first two. They can be addressed  by the design and speed of the display and computer. The intent of this criterion  is to ensure that flicker that violates the flash thresholds is not caused by the  content itself. For example, the content could contain a video clip or animated image  of a series of strobe flashes, or close-ups of rapid-fire explosions.  </p><p>This Success Criterion replaces a much more restrictive criterion in WCAG 1.0 that  did not allow any flashing (even of a single pixel) within a broad frequency range  (3 to 50 Hz). This Success Criterion is based on existing specifications in use in  the UK and by others for television broadcast and has been adapted for computer display  viewing. In WCAG 2.0, a 1024 x 768 screen was used as the reference screen resolution for the  evaluation. The 341 x 256 pixel block represents a 10 degree viewport at a typical  viewing distance. (The 10 degree field is taken from the original specifications and  represents the central vision portion of the eye, where people are most susceptible  to photo stimuli.)  </p><p>With the proliferation of devices of varying screen sizes (from small hand-helds to large living room displays), as well as the adoption of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-css-pixels">CSS pixels</a> as a density-independent unit of measurement, the prior assessment criteria may seem outdated. However, an image of a consistent size uses up relatively the same percentage of a user's visual field on any device. On a large screen, the image takes up less size, but the large screen takes up a larger part of the visual field. On a mobile screen, the image may take up most or all of the screen; however, the mobile screen itself takes up a smaller portion of the user's visual field. So the same dimension of the flashing content, represented in CSS pixels can still provide a consistent means of assessment. Substituting CSS pixels for the original pixel block means that the combined area of flashing becomes 341 x 256 CSS pixels, or a flashing area of 87,296 CSS pixels.</p><p>Content should be analyzed at the largest scale at which a user may view the content, and at the standard zoom level of the user agent. For example, with a video that may play in an area of a web page and also at full screen, the video should be analyzed for risks at full screen.</p><p>Where video content is provided in color spaces other than sRGB, the version provided with the highest dynamic range should be tested. In such cases the industry standard definition of a general flash is a change in luminance of 20 cd/m2 or more where the darker image is below 160 cd/m2. (<a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.1702/">ITU-R BT.1702</a>.) This is applicable for standard dynamic range (SDR) and high dynamic range (HDR) content. For HDR content when the darker state is 160 cd/m2 or more, a general flash is one where the Michelson contrast is 1/17 or greater — where the Michelson contrast is calculated as (LHigh - LLow) / (LHigh + LLow), and where LHigh and LLow are the luminance of the high and low luminance states, respectively.</p><p>For short clips that might be looped (such as GIF animations), the content should be analyzed while looping. </p><p class="note">The specification cannot account for the actual viewing distance that a person chooses. Users that are closer to their screens than the idealized viewing distance will be affected by flashing areas that normatively pass. The same problem applies to users who rely on zoom or screen magnification. Conversely, users who are further away from the screen than the idealized distance should be able to tolerate flashing areas that are larger than the threshold.</p><p>The combined area of flashes occurring concurrently and contiguously means the total  area that is actually flashing at the same time. It is calculated by adding up the  contiguous area that is flashing simultaneously within any 10 degree angle of view.  </p><div class="note">  <p>The terms "blinking" and "flashing" can sometimes refer to the same content.</p>  <ul>  <li>"Blinking" refers to content that causes a distraction problem.

This reduces confusion  by letting users form a consistent mental model of the content. There may be different  orders that reflect logical relationships in the content. For example, moving through  components in a table one row at a time or one column at a time both reflect the logical  relationships in the content. Either order may satisfy this Success Criterion.  </p><p>The way that sequential navigation order is determined in Web content is defined by  the technology of the content. For example, simple HTML defines sequential navigation  via the notion of tabbing order. Dynamic HTML may modify the navigation sequence using  scripting along with the addition of a tabindex attribute to allow focus to additional  elements. If no scripting or tabindex attributes are used, the navigation order is  the order that components appear in the content stream. (See HTML 4.01 Specification,  section 17.11, "Giving focus to an element").  </p><p>An example of keyboard navigation that is not the sequential navigation addressed  by this Success Criterion is using arrow key navigation to traverse a tree component.  The user can use the up and down arrow keys to move from tree node to tree node. Pressing  the right arrow key may expand a node, then using the down arrow key, will move into  the newly expanded nodes. This navigation sequence follows the expected sequence for  a tree control - as additional items get expanded or collapsed, they are added or  removed from the navigation sequence.  </p><p>The focus order may not be identical to the programmatically determined reading order  (see Success Criterion 1.3.2) as long as the user can still understand and operate  the Web page. Since there may be several possible logical reading orders for the content,  the focus order may match any of them. However, when the order of a particular presentation  differs from the programmatically determined reading order, users of one of these  presentations may find it difficult to understand or operate the Web page. Authors  should carefully consider all these users as they design their Web pages.  </p><p>For example, a screen reader user interacts with the programmatically determined reading  order, while a sighted keyboard user interacts with the visual presentation of the  Web page. Care should be taken so that the focus order makes sense to both of these  sets of users and does not appear to either of them to jump around randomly. </p><p>For clarity:</p><ol>  <li>Focusable components need to receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and  operability only when navigation sequences affect meaning and operability.  </li>  <li>In those cases where it is required, there may be more than one order that will preserve  meaning and operability.  </li>  <li>If there is more than one order that preserves meaning and operability, only one of  them needs to be provided.  </li>  </ol></blockquote></section></section><section id="link-purpose-in-context"><div class="header-wrapper"><h5 id="x6-2-5-5-link-purpose-in-context">2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)</h5><a class="self-link" href="#link-purpose-in-context" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.2.5.5"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <a>purpose of each link</a> can be determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its  <a>programmatically determined link context</a>, except where the purpose of the link would be <a>ambiguous to users in general</a>.  </p></blockquote>

Assistive technology has the ability to provide users with a list of links that are  on the Web page. Link text that is as meaningful as possible will aid users who want  to choose from this list of links. Meaningful link text also helps those who wish  to tab from link to link. Meaningful links help users choose which links to follow  without requiring complicated strategies to understand the page.  </p><p>The text of, or associated with, the link is intended to describe the purpose of the  link.

In this case the  user should be able to identify the purpose of the link without moving focus from  the link. In other words, they can arrive on a link and find out more about it without  losing their place. This can be achieved by putting the description of the link in  the same sentence, paragraph, list item, or table cell as the link, or in the table header cell for a link in a data table, because these are directly associated with the link itself. Alternatively, authors may choose to use an ARIA technique to associate additional  text on the page with the link.  </p><p>This context will be most usable if it precedes the link.

This information may also be provided in text - the goal is to ensure that the end user knows what the purpose of the link is. </p><p>The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the  link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation,  the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context  available to understand the link purpose.

<p>The definitions of “<a href="#set-of-documents">set of documents</a>” and “<a href="#set-of-software-programs">set of software programs</a>” in the Key Terms section of the Introduction are predicated on the ability to navigate from each element of the set to each other, and navigation is a type of locating. So the mechanism used to navigate between elements of the set will be one way of locating information in the set. Non-web environments, generally major operating systems with browse and search capabilities, often provide infrastructure and tools that provide mechanisms for locating content in a set of non-web documents or a set of software programs. For example, it may be possible to browse through the files or programs that make up a set, or search within members of the set for the names of other members. A file directory would be the equivalent of a site map for documents in a set, and a search function in a file system would be equivalent to a web search function for web pages.

For sighted people who rely on a keyboard (or on a device that operates through the keyboard interface, such as a switch or voice input), knowing the current point of focus is critical. The component with focus signals the interaction point on the page. Where users cannot see the item with focus, they may not know how to proceed, or may even think the system has become unresponsive.</p><p>In recognition of the complex responsive designs common today, this AA criterion allows for the component receiving focus to be <em>partially</em> obscured by other author-created content. A partly obscured component can still be very visible, although the more of it that is obscured, the less easy it is to see. For that reason, authors should attempt to design interactions to reduce the degree and frequency with which the item receiving focus is partly obscured. For best visibility, <em>none</em> of the component receiving focus should be hidden. This preferred outcome is covered by the AAA criterion <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-not-obscured-enhanced.html">Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced)</a>.</p><p>Typical types of content that can overlap focused items are sticky footers, sticky headers, and non-modal dialogs.

Some people cannot perform gestures in a precise manner, or they may use a specialized or adapted input device such as a head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-controlled mouse emulator. Some pointing methods lack the capability or accuracy to perform multipoint or path-based gestures.</p><p>A <strong>path-based gesture</strong> involves an interaction where not just the endpoints matter. If going through an intermediate point (usually near the start of the gesture) also affects its meaning then it is a path-based gesture. The user engages a pointer (starting point), carries out a movement that goes through at least one intermediate-point before disengaging the pointer (end point). The intermediate point defines the gesture as requiring a specific path, even if the complete path is not defined.</p><figure id="figure-path-based-gesture-1">  <img src="img/path-based-gesture-1.png" width="400" alt="Hand showing a starting touch, 1. Moving through a second point, 2.

The end-point may be a continuation, or allow for various movements.</figcaption>  </figure><p>Examples of path-based gestures include swiping, sliders and carousels dependent on the direction of interaction, and other gestures which trace a prescribed path such as drawing a specific shape. Such paths may be drawn with a finger or stylus on a touchscreen, graphics tablet, or trackpad, or with a mouse, joystick, or similar pointer device.</p><p>Dragging is a movement where the user picks up an object with a pointer (such as mouse cursor or a finger) and moves it to some other position. This movement from start point to end point does not require the user to follow any particular path or direction. Dragging is therefore not path-based. In contrast, a path-based pointer gesture requires the traversal of an intermediate point, which is a technical way of expressing that the directionality and possibly speed of the gesture communicates a particular command to the system. Dragging motions are covered in <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging.html">Success Criterion 2.5.7: Dragging</a>.</p><figure id="figure-path-based-gesture-2">  <img src="img/path-based-gesture-2.png" width="400" alt="Hand showing a starting touch, 1. Going to a second point, 2. It follows a very random path.">  <figcaption>A free-form gesture does not require any particular path before the end-point, only the start and (optionally) the end point matter.</figcaption>  </figure><p class="note">Any movement of a pointer could be difficult or impossible to use for someone who cannot perform precise movements, therefore alternative forms of interaction are always recommended. This success criterion is scoped to <em>path-based gestures</em> as it may be difficult or impossible to provide an alternative for free-form paths.</p><p>Examples of <strong>multipoint</strong> gestures include a two-finger pinch zoom, a split tap where one finger rests on the screen and a second finger taps, or a two- or three-finger tap or swipe. Users may find it difficult or impossible to accomplish these if they type and point with a single finger or stick.</p><p>Authors must ensure that their content can be operated without multipoint or path-based gestures. Multipoint or path-based gestures can be used so long as the functionality can also be operated by another method, such as a tap, click, double tap, double click, long press, or click &amp; hold. </p><p>This Success Criterion applies to gestures in the author-provided content, not gestures defined by the operating system, user agent, or assistive technology. Examples of operating system gestures would be swiping down to see system notifications and gestures for built-in assistive technologies (AT). Examples of user agent-implemented gestures would be horizontal swiping implemented by browsers for navigating within the page history, or vertical swiping to scroll page content.</p><p>There are times when a component requires a path-based gesture for touch screen devices but not with a mouse. Taking an example of a generic slider:</p><ul>  <li><strong>Using a mouse:</strong> If the user clicks on the thumb control of the slider and moves vertically, the slider will respond by moving to the right or left, even if the movement is mostly upwards. There will be no page scrolling as a result of the vertical movement as long as they drag with focus on the slider. Therefore, the slider does not require a path-based gesture with mouse pointer.</li>  <li><strong>Using a touch-screen:</strong> If the user puts their finger on the thumb control of the slider and moves upwards more than sideways, the slider may not respond because the browser takes control of the swipe and interprets it as a scroll, and will move the page up and down. Moving left or right on the slider thumb engages the slider and then the user can vary their vertical movement. This implementation has the 3-point requirement to work with a finger on a touch screen device so is a path-based gesture.</li>  </ul><p>As touch screen devices can apply default gestures it is important to test with them if you are unsure whether a particular component does require a path-based gesture.</p><p>Browsers on a touch screen device generally provide some default gestures that impact whether a path-based gesture is needed. For example, a web browser on a touch-screen devices might detect a vertical gesture and scroll the page. If a user places their finger on a slider thumb and moves up (to scroll down) that might not activate the slider (depending on implementation). If the user moves horizontally first then the slider could capture that gesture and ignore vertical movement, resulting in a path-based gesture. If you include touch-screen devices as accessibility supported then these types of interaction need testing with a touch screen as using a mouse in a similar way would not trigger the same browser behavior.</p><p>This Success Criterion does not require all functionality to be available through pointing devices, but if it is available to pointer devices then it should not require path-based gestures. While content authors generally need to provide keyboard commands or other non-pointer mechanisms that perform actions equivalent to complex gestures (see Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard), this is not sufficient to conform to this Success Criterion. That is because some users rely entirely on pointing devices, or find simple pointer inputs much easier to perform and understand than alternatives. For example, a user relying on a head-pointer would find clicking a control to be much more convenient than activating an on-screen keyboard to emulate a keyboard shortcut, and a person who has difficulty memorizing a series of keys (or gestures) may find it much easier to simply click on a labeled control. Therefore, if one or more pointer-based mechanisms are supported, then their benefits should be afforded to users through simple, single-point actions alone.</p><p>Single pointer operations include taps and clicks, double-taps and double-clicks, long presses, swiping, dragging, and path-based gestures. Gestures such as "pinch to zoom" or two-finger swipes are <em>multipoint</em> gestures, as they require two or more pointer inputs - in this case, two fingers on a touchscreen.</p><p>An exception is made for functionality that is inherently and necessarily based on complex paths or multipoint gestures. For example, entering your signature may be inherently path-based (although acknowledging something or confirming your identity need not be).</p><p>Gestures that involve dragging in any direction are not in scope for this SC because only the start and end points matter in a dragging operation. However, such gestures do require fine motor control. Authors are encouraged to provide non-dragging methods, for instance, a drag and drop operation could also be achieved by selecting an item (with a tap or keyboard interaction) and then selecting its destination as a second step.</p><section id="251-pointer-gestures-section-benefits">  <h3 id="251-pointer-gestures-benefits">Benefits</h3>  <ul>  <li><p>Users who cannot (accurately) perform path-based pointer gestures - on a touchscreen, or with a mouse - will have alternative means for operating the content.</p></li>  <li><p>Users who cannot perform multi-pointer gestures on a touchscreen (for instance, because they are operating the touchscreen with an alternative input such as a head pointer) will have a single-pointer alternative for operating the content.</p></li>  <li><p>Users who may not understand the custom gesture interaction intended by the author will be able to rely on simple, frequently used gestures to interact.

Users who have difficulty accurately using a mouse or touchscreen benefit greatly from this basic behaviour. They normally receive visual feedback when an item is pressed. If they discover they have selected the wrong item, they can cancel the action by moving their pointer or finger away from the target before releasing.</p>  <p>For more complex interactions, such as drag and drop, the down- and up-events may initiate and end a series of actions to complete a process. For example, with drag and drop, the item may be:</p>  <ol>  <li>selected with a press (down-event),</li>  <li>moved to a new location, while still being depressed, and</li>  <li>released (up-event) to conclude the drop action.</li> </ol> <p>In such a complex action, the need for an Abort or Undo function increases. Designers may elect to confirm the move through something like a confirmation dialog or an undo button, giving the user the ability to Undo the process just completed. Alternatively, the ability to Abort the action can be achieved if, before completing step 3, the user returns the selected item to its original location and concludes the process there. If other parts of the screen disallow a move, the user can conclude the drag and drop there, effectively nullifying the operation.</p> </section><section> <h3 id="252-pointer-cancellation-up-reversal">Up Reversal</h3> <p>In other interactions, the down-event may trigger a behaviour which can be reversed when the up-event concludes. Examples of this include press-and-hold actions such as where a transient popup appears (or a video plays) when the user presses on an object (down-event), but the popup (or video) disappears as soon as the user releases the pointer (up-event). Since the up-event reverses the preceding down event, the user is returned to their prior point, and has effectively cancelled the operation.</p>  </section><section> <h3 id="252-pointer-cancellation-down-event">Down-Event</h3> <p>Completing the function on the down-event is only permitted when it is essential that the up-event not be used.</p> <p>The most prevalent essential down-event activation occurs in keyboard emulation. On a physical keyboard, keys by default activate on the down-event -- a letter appears when the key is pressed. If a software keyboard emulator tried to override this expected behaviour by making letters appear when the key is released, the behaviour would be unexpected and would adversely affect expected interaction.</p> <p>Note that a keyboard has a built-in Backspace or Delete button, which effectively provides an Undo option. Undo is not a requirement of the down-event Essential exception; however, providing an easy way for users to undo any action is a recommended practice (and may be a functional necessity), even where it is not a requirement of this Success Criterion.</p>  <p>Other examples where the timing of an activation is essential and requires the down-event would be:</p>  <ul>  <li>An activity that emulates a physical on-press trigger, such as when playing an on-screen piano keyboard. Activation on the up-event would significantly alter the desired behaviour.</li>  <li>A program for shooting skeets where waiting for the "up" event would invalidate the precise timing necessary for the activation.</li>  </ul>  </section></blockquote></section></section><section id="label-in-name"><div class="header-wrapper"><h5 id="x6-2-6-4-label-in-name">2.5.3 Label in Name</h5><a class="self-link" href="#label-in-name" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.2.6.4"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For <a>user interface components</a> with <a>labels</a> that include <a>text</a> or <a>images of text</a>, the <a>name</a> contains the text that is presented visually.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">A best practice is to have the text of the label at the start of the name.</p></blockquote>

</section><section><h5 id="intent-from-understanding-2.5.3-label-in-name">Intent from Understanding 2.5.3 Label in Name</h5><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that the words which visually label a component are also the words associated with the component programmatically. This helps ensure that people with disabilities can rely on visible labels as a means to interact with the components.</p><p>Most controls are accompanied by a visible text <strong>label</strong>. Those same controls have a programmatic <strong>name</strong>, also known as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/">Accessible Name</a>. Users typically have a much better experience if the words and characters in the visible label of a control match or are contained within the accessible name. When these match, speech-input users (i.e., users of speech recognition applications) can navigate by speaking the visible text labels of components, such as menus, links, and buttons, that appear on the screen. Sighted users who use text-to-speech (e.g., screen readers) will also have a better experience if the text they hear matches the text they see on the screen.</p><p>Note that where a visible text label does not exist for a component, this Success Criterion does not apply to that component.</p><p>Where text labels exist and are properly linked to the user interface components through established authoring practices, the label and name will normally match. When they don't match, speech-input users who attempt to use the visible text label as a means of navigation or selection (e.g., "move to Password") will be unsuccessful. The speech-based navigation fails because the visible label spoken by the users does not match (or is not part of) the accessible name that is enabled as a speech-input command. In addition, when the accessible name is different from the visible label, it may function as a hidden command that can be accidentally activated by speech-input users.</p><p>Mismatches between visible labels and programmatic names for controls are even more of an issue for speech-input and text-to-speech users who also have cognitive challenges. Mismatches create an extra cognitive load for speech-input users, who must remember to say a speech command that is different from the visible label they see on a control. It also creates extra cognitive load for a text-to-speech user to absorb and understand speech output that does not match the visible label.</p><p>In order for the label text and accessible name to be matched, it is first necessary to determine which text on the screen should be considered a label for any given control. There are often multiple text strings in a user interface that may be relevant to a control. However, there are reasons why it is best to conservatively interpret the label as being only the text in close proximity.</p><p>Conventionally the label for user interface components is the adjacent text string. The typical positioning for left to right languages is:</p><ul><li>immediately to the left of comboboxes, dropdown lists, text inputs, and other widgets (or in the absence of left-side labels, immediately above and aligned with the left edge of each input)</li> <li>immediately to the right of checkboxes and radio buttons</li> <li>inside buttons and tabs or immediately below icons serving as buttons</li> </ul><p>The rationale for some of these conventions is explained in <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2016/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20160105/G162">G162: Positioning labels to maximize predictability of relationships</a>. </p><p>It is important to bias towards treating only the adjacent text as a label because liberal interpretations of what constitutes a text label can jeopardize the value of this Success Criterion (SC) by lessening predictability. Isolating the label to the single string in close proximity to the component makes it easier for developers, testers, and end users to identify the label targeted for evaluation in this SC. Predictable interpretation of labeling allows users of speech recognition technologies to interact with the element via its conventionally positioned label, and allows users of screen reading technologies to enjoy consistency between the nearby visible label and the announced name of the component.</p><p>Note that placeholder text within an input field is not considered an appropriate means of providing a label. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#the-placeholder-attribute">HTML5 specification</a> states <q>The placeholder attribute should not be used as an alternative to a &lt;label&gt;.</q> However, it is worth noting that "label" in that HTML5 statement is in code brackets and links to the <code>label</code> element. For the purposes of this Label in Name Success Criterion, "label" is not used in such a programmatic sense but is simply referring to a text string in close visual proximity to a component. As such, in the absence of any other nearby text string (as described in the preceding list), if an input contains placeholder text, such text may be a candidate for Label in Name. This is supported both through the accessible name calculation (discussed later) and from the practical sense that where a visible label is not otherwise provided, it is likely that a speech-input user may attempt to use the placeholder text value as a means of interacting with the input.</p><section> <h3 id="253-label-in-name-text-labels-express-something-in-human-language">Text labels "express something in human language"</h3>  <section> <h4 id="253-label-in-name-symbolic-text-characters">Symbolic text characters</h4> <p>For the purposes of this SC, text should not be considered a visible label if it is used in a symbolic manner, rather than directly <q>expressing something in human language</q> as per the definition of <a>text</a> in WCAG. For example, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#images-of-text">1.4.5 Images of Text</a> describes considerations for "symbolic text characters." In the images of text example "B", "I", and "ABC" appear on icons in a text editor, where they are meant to symbolize the functions for Bold, Italics, and Spelling, respectively. In such a case, the accessible name should be the function the button serves (e.g., "Spell check" or "Check spelling"), not the visible symbolic characters. A similar text editor is shown in the figure below.</p> <figure id="figure-RTE-github">  <img alt="Icons for transforming text, including heading, bold, italic, quote, code, and link, along with icons for ordered and unordered lists and other controls" src="img/rich-text-editor-detail.png">  <figcaption>A detail of the rich text editor in Github, showing a variety of unlabeled icons, including icons resembling text characters.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Likewise, where an author has used a greater-than symbol ("&gt;") to mimic the appearance of the right-facing arrow, the text does not convey something in human language. It is a symbol, in this scenario likely meant to mimic the icons used for a "Play" button or a "Next" arrow.</p> <h4 id="253-label-in-name-punctuation-and-capitalization">Punctuation and capitalization</h4>  </section>  <section> <p>The use of punctuation and capitalization in labels <em>may</em> also be considered optional for the same reason. For example, the colon conventionally added at the end of input labels does not express something in human language, and capitals on the first letter of each word in a label do not normally alter the words' meaning. This is particularly relevant in the context of this SC, since it is primarily aimed at users of speech recognition; capitals and most punctuation are frequently ignored when a user speaks a label as a means of interacting with a control.</p> <p>While it is certainly not an error to include the colon and capitalization in the accessible name, a computed name of "First name" should not be considered a failure of "First Name:".<br> <label for="firstname">First Name: </label><input id="firstname" type="text" name="firstname"><br> Likewise, "Next…" visibly shown on a button could have "Next" as the accessible name. When in doubt, where a meaningful visible label exists, match the string exactly for the accessible name.<br> <input type="submit" value="Next..."></p>  </section>  <section>  <h4 id="253-label-in-name-mathematical-expressions-and-formulae">Mathematical expressions and formulae</h4> <p>Mathematical expressions are an exception to the previous subsection about symbolic characters. Math symbols can be used as labels; for example "11×3=33" and "A&gt;B" convey meaning. The label should not be overwritten in the accessible name, and substitutions of words where a formula is used should be avoided since there are multiple ways to express the same equation. For example, making the name "eleven multiplied by three is equivalent to thirty-three" might mean a user who said "eleven times three equals thirty-three" may not match. It is best to leave the formulas as used in the label and count on the user's familiarity with their speech software to achieve a match. Further, converting a mathematical formula label into an accessible name that is a spelled-out equivalent may create issues for translation. The name should match the label's formula text. Note that a consideration for authors is to use the proper symbol in the formula. For instance 11x3 (with a lower or upper case letter X), 11*3 (with the asterisk symbol), and 11×3 (with the <code>&amp;</code>times<code>;</code> symbol) are all easy for sighted users to interpret as meaning the same formula, but may not all be matched to "11 times 3" by the speech recognition software. The proper operator symbol (in this case the times symbol) should be used.<br>   <input type="radio" name="equation" id="answer1" value="A>B"><label for="answer1">A&gt;B</label>  <input type="radio" name="equation" id="answer2" value="A=B"><label for="answer2">A=B</label>  <input type="radio" name="equation" id="answer3" value="A<B"><label for="answer3">A&lt;B</label></p>  </section>  </section><section>   <h3 id="253-label-in-name-accessible-name-and-description-computation-specification">Accessible Name and Description Computation specification</h3>  <p>It is important to understand how the accessible name is derived. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/">Accessible Name and Description Computation 1.1</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/#accessible-name-and-description-computation">HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0</a> describe how the accessible name is computed, including which attributes are considered in its calculation, and in what order of preference. If a component has multiple possible attribute values that could be used for its accessible name, only the most preferred of those values will be computed. None of the other, less preferred values will be part of the name. For the most part, existing established programmatic relationships between labels and controls are reinforced by the specification.</p>  <p>Other text displayed on the screen that is correctly coded to meet 1.3.1: Info and Relationships is <strong>not</strong> normally factored into the calculation for the accessible name of a UI component without author intervention (via ARIA labeling techniques). The most common of these are:</p>  <ul>  <li>headings and instructions</li> <li>group labels for sets of components (i.e., used with <code>legend</code>/<code>fieldset</code> or with role of <code>group</code> or <code>radiogroup</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Such textual information may constitute part of the component's <em>description</em>. So from both a programmatic viewpoint, and from the conservative tactic of only considering a label to be "adjacent text," neither headings, instructions, nor group 'labels' should normally be considered <strong>labels</strong> for the purpose of this Success Criterion.</p>  <p>It is important to note that the specification allows authors to override the name calculated through native semantics. Both <code>aria-label</code> and <code>aria-labelledby</code> take precedence in the name calculation, overriding the visible text as the accessible name even when the visible text label is programmatically associated with the control. For this reason, when a visible label already exists, <code>aria-label</code> should be avoided or used carefully, and <code>aria-labelledby</code> should be used as a supplement with care.</p> <p>Finally, <code>aria-describedby</code> is not included in the Accessible Name computation (instead it is part of the Accessible Description computation). By convention, text associated with a control through <code>aria-describedby</code> is announced immediately after the accessible name by screen readers. Therefore, the context of headings, instructions, and group labels can be provided through the accessible description to assist users of screen readers without affecting the experience of those who navigate using speech recognition software.</p>  </section></blockquote></section></section><section id="motion-actuation"><div class="header-wrapper"><h5 id="x6-2-6-5-motion-actuation">2.5.4 Motion Actuation</h5><a class="self-link" href="#motion-actuation" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.2.6.5"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">  <a>Functionality</a> that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by <a>user interface components</a> and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when:</p><dl xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">  <dt>Supported Interface</dt>  <dd>The motion is used to operate functionality through an <a>accessibility supported</a> interface;</dd>  <dt>Essential</dt>  <dd>The motion is <a>essential</a> for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity.</dd>  </dl></blockquote>

However, achieving keyboard equivalence for a dragging operation does not automatically meet this Success Criterion. It is possible to create an interface that works with dragging and keyboard controls that does not work using only clicks or taps. While many designs can be created for a dragging alternative which address both keyboard accessibility and operability by single pointer operation, the two requirements should be assessed independently.</p>   <p>This Success Criterion applies to dragging movements as opposed to pointer gestures, which are covered in <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pointer-gestures">Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures</a>. Pointer gestures include directional path-based as well as multi-point gestures. In contrast, for dragging movements, only the start and end point of the movement matters, not the actual path.</p>   <p>Additional examples are selection rectangles that set the first x/y rectangle coordinate at the pointer position via a pointer down-event, and the second x/y coordinate, after a dragging movement, at the next up-event. A similar example is a connecting line drawn between two different items on the screen, as in an allocation test where users are required to draw a line between questions and corresponding answers. In these cases, the dragging movement requires an alternative way to accomplish the same action that does not rely on the dragging movement.

Users with dexterity limitations and those who have difficulty with fine motor movement find it difficult to accurately activate small targets when there are other targets that are too close. Providing sufficient size, or sufficient spacing between targets, will reduce the likelihood of accidentally activating the wrong control.</p><p>Disabilities addressed by this requirement include hand tremors, spasticity, and quadriplegia. Some people with disabilities use specialized input devices instead of a computer mouse or trackpad. Typically these types of input device do not provide as much accuracy as mainstream pointing devices. Meeting this requirement also ensures that touchscreen interfaces are easier to use.</p><p class="note">This Success Criterion defines a <em>minimum size</em> and, if this can't be met, a <em>minimum spacing</em>. It is still possible to have very small, and difficult to activate, targets and meet the requirements of this Success Criterion, provided that the targets don't have any adjacent targets that are too close. However, using larger target sizes will help many people use targets more easily. <em>As a best practice</em> it is recommended to at least meet the <em>minimum size</em> requirement of the Success Criterion, regardless of spacing. For important links/controls, consider aiming for the stricter <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-enhanced">2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced)</a>.</p><section id="258-target-size-minimum-section-exceptions">  <h3 id="258-target-size-minimum-exceptions">Exceptions</h3>  <p>The requirement is for targets to be at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels in size. There are five exceptions:</p>   <ul>  <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Undersized targets (those less than 24 by 24 CSS pixels) are positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the <a>bounding box</a> of each, the circles do not intersect another target or the circle for another undersized target.</li>  <li><strong>Equivalent:</strong> In cases where a target does not have a size equivalent to 24 by 24 CSS pixels, but there is another control that can achieve the underlying function that <em>does</em> meet the minimum size, the target can be excepted based on the "Equivalent" exception.</li>  <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The Success Criterion does not apply to inline targets in sentences, or where the size of the target is constrained by the line-height of non-target text. This exception is allowed because text reflow based on viewport size makes it impossible for authors to anticipate where links may be positioned relative to one another. When multiple links are embedded in blocks of texts in smaller text sizes, guaranteeing that undersized links in adjacent lines of text fulfill the spacing exception (their 24 CSS pixel diameter circle don't intersect any other links or their circles) would require a large line height which can be undesirable in many design contexts.</li>  <li><strong>User agent control:</strong> Browsers have default renderings of some controls, such as the days of the month calendar in an <code>&lt;input type="date"&gt;</code>. As long as the author has not modified the user agent default, the target size for a <q>User agent control</q> is excepted.</li>  <li><strong>Essential:</strong> If the size and spacing of the targets is fundamental to the information being conveyed, the <q>Essential</q> exception applies. For example, in digital maps, the position of pins is analogous to the position of places shown on the map. If there are many pins close together, the spacing between pins and neighboring pins will often be below 24 CSS pixels. It is essential to show the pins at the correct map location, therefore the Essential exception applies. A similar example is an interactive data visualization where targets are necessarily dense. Another example is where jurisdictions legally require online forms to replicate paper forms, which can impose constraints on the size of targets. In such jurisdictions, any legal requirement to replicate small targets can be considered essential. When the essential exception is applicable, authors are strongly encouraged to provide equivalent functionality through alternative means to the extent practical.</li>  </ul>  </section><section id="258-target-size-minimum-section-size-requirement">  <h3 id="258-target-size-minimum-size-requirement">Size requirement</h3>   <p>For a target to be "at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels", it must be possible to draw a solid 24 by 24 CSS pixel square, aligned to the horizontal and vertical axis such that the square is completely within the target (does not extend outside the target's area).</p>   <figure id="target-size-basic">  <img src="img/target-size-basic.svg" width="180" height="75" alt="Three square boxes next to each other, each with a height and width of 24px">  <figcaption>Where targets are a 24 by 24px square (and larger is better), they meet the size requirement of the criterion and pass (image shown to scale - <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/img/target-size-basic.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>The 24 by 24px square has to be aligned with the page, although the target itself could be skewed.</p>   <figure id="target-size-skewed">  <img src="img/target-size-skewed.svg" width="130" height="120" alt="A skewed rectangle that includes a 24 by 24px square within it.">  <figcaption>So long as there is a solid 24 by 24px square within the target, it meets the size requirement of the criterion and passes (image shown to scale - <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/img/target-size-skewed.svg">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>If a target is not large enough to allow for a 24 by 24px square to be drawn inside it, it is considered <em>undersized</em>, and does not pass the size requirement of the Success Criterion.

There is less chance of accidentally activating a neighboring target if a target is not immediately adjacent to another. Touchscreen devices and user agents generally have internal heuristics to identify which link or control is closest to a user's touch interaction - this means that sufficient spacing between targets can work as effectively as a larger target size itself.</p>   <p>When a target is smaller than 24 by 24 CSS pixels, it is <em>undersized</em>. In this case, we check if it at least has sufficient <em>spacing</em> by drawing a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle over the undersized target, centered on the target's <a>bounding box</a>. For rectangular targets, the bounding box coincides with the target itself – thus, the circle is placed on the center of the target. If the target is <em>not</em> rectangular – for instance, if the target is clipped, has rounded corners, or if it's a more complex clickable SVG shape – we need to first determine the bounding box, and then find the box's center. Note that for concave shapes, the center of the bounding box may be outside of the target itself. Now, we center the circle on the center of the bounding box.</p>   <figure id="target-size-bounding-boxes">  <img src="img/target-size-bounding-boxes.svg" width="395" height="100" alt="Three undersized targets - a square target, a convex target, and a concave target; the concave and convex targets have a bounding box around them; all three targets have a 24 CSS pixel circle centered on the center of their bounding box">  <figcaption>For a square/rectangular target, the 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the target itself. For convex and concave targets, it is centered on the bounding box of the shape.

To determine if an undersized target has sufficient spacing (to pass this Success Criterion's spacing exception), we check that the 24 CSS pixel diameter circle of the target does not intersect another target or the circle of any other adjacent undersized targets.</p>   <p>The following example shows a horizontal row of icon-based buttons. In the top row, the dimensions of each target are 24 by 24 CSS pixels, passing this Success Criterion. In the second row, the same targets are only 20 by 20 CSS pixels, but have a 4 CSS pixel space between them – as the target size is below 24 by 24 CSS pixels, these need to be evaluated against the Success Criterion's spacing exception, and they pass. In the last row, the targets are again 20 by 20 CSS pixels, but have no space between them – these fail the spacing exception, because when drawing the 24 CSS pixel diameter circles over the targets, the circles intersect.</p>   <figure id="target-spacing-toolbar">  <img src="img/target-spacing-toolbar.svg" width="560" height="265" alt="Three rows showing a horizontal toolbar of icon-based controls with measurements.

This makes it possible for user agents and  assistive technologies to present content according to the presentation and pronunciation  rules for that language. This applies to graphical browsers as well as screen readers,  braille displays, and other voice browsers.  </p><p>Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately  if the language of each passage of text is identified. Screen readers can use the  pronunciation rules of the language of the text. Visual browsers can display characters  and scripts in appropriate ways. This is especially important when switching between  languages that read from left to right and languages that read from right to left,  or when text is rendered in a language that uses a different alphabet. Users with  disabilities who know all the languages used in the Web page will be better able to  understand the content when each passage is rendered appropriately. </p><p>When no other language has been specified for a phrase or passage of text, its human  language is the default human language of the Web page (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/language-of-page.html">Success Criterion 3.1.1</a>). So the human language of all content in single language documents can be programmatically  determined. </p><p>Individual words or phrases in one language can become part of another language. For  example, "rendezvous" is a French word that has been adopted in English, appears in  English dictionaries, and is properly pronounced by English screen readers. Hence  a passage of English text may contain the word "rendezvous" without specifying that  its human language is French and still satisfy this Success Criterion. Frequently,  when the human language of text appears to be changing for a single word, that word  has become part of the language of the surrounding text. Because this is so common  in some languages, single words should be considered part of the language of the surrounding  text unless it is clear that a change in language was intended. If there is doubt  whether a change in language is intended, consider whether the word would be pronounced  the same (except for accent or intonation) in the language of the immediately surrounding  text.  </p><p>Most professions require frequent use of technical terms which may originate from  a foreign language. Such terms are usually not translated to all languages. The universal  nature of technical terms also facilitate communication between professionals.  </p><p>Some common examples of technical terms include: Homo sapiens, Alpha Centauri, hertz,  and habeas corpus.  </p><p>Identifying changes in language is important for a number of reasons:</p><ul>  <li>It allows braille translation software to follow changes in language, e.g., substitute  control codes for accented characters, and insert control codes necessary to prevent  erroneous creation of Grade 2 braille contractions.  </li>  <li>Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages will be able to speak the text  in the appropriate accent with proper pronunciation. If changes are not marked, the  synthesizer will try its best to speak the words in the default language it works  in. Thus, the French word for car, "<span lang="fr">voiture</span>" would be pronounced "voyture" by a speech  synthesizer that uses English as its default language. </li>  <li>Marking changes in language can benefit future developments in technology, for example  users who are unable to translate between languages themselves will be able to use  machines to translate unfamiliar languages. </li>  <li>Marking changes in language can also assist user agents in providing definitions using  a dictionary. </li>  </ul></blockquote></section></section></section><section id="predictable"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x6-3-3-predictable">3.2 Predictable</h4><a class="self-link" href="#predictable" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.3.3"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.</p></blockquote>

When the placement of the help mechanism is kept consistent across a set of pages, users looking for help will find it easier to identify. This is distinct from interface-level help, such as contextual help, features like spell checkers, and instructional text in a form. </p><p>Locating the help mechanism in a consistent location across pages makes it easier for users to find it. For example, when a mechanism or link is located in the header of one Web page, it will be easier to find if it is in the header of other pages. The help mechanism, such as a contact phone number, may be provided directly on the page, or it may also be a direct link to a contact page. Regardless of which approach is used, the mechanism must be located in the same relative order on each page within the set of pages.</p><p>When testing this Success Criterion, it is the help item which is relative to the rest of the content. When testing a page, other content that is present across the set of web pages and is before the help item should be before the help item on this page. Items which are after the help item on other pages should be after the help item on this page.</p><p>If the help item is visually in a different location, but in the same serial order, that is not helpful from a user's point of view, but it would not fail this criterion.</p><p>The location in a smaller viewport may be different than in a larger viewport, but it is best if the mechanism or link is consistent across a set of web pages. A consistent location, both visually and programmatically, is the most usable.</p><p>When having problems completing a task on a Web site (or part of a Web site, what we call a <a>set of Web pages</a>), people with some types of disabilities may not be able to work through the issue without further help. Issues could include difficulty:  completing a form, or finding a document or page which provides information required to complete a task.</p><p>Without help, some users may abandon the task. They may also fail to correctly complete a task, or they may require assistance from people who do not necessarily keep private information secure.</p><p>It is not the intent of this Success Criterion to require authors to provide help / access to help. The Criterion only requires that <em>when</em> one of the listed forms of help is available across multiple pages that it be in a consistent location. It does not require authors to provide help information on PDFs or other static documents that may be available for viewing/download from the Web pages. PDFs and other static documents are not considered part of the "set of web pages" from which they are downloaded.</p><p>It is also not the intent of this Success Criterion to require a human be available at all times.

For example, an online jobs / recruitment portal may provide a contact method for the team that supports the recruitment portal and not a catch-all for the entire company. Each layer of contact added prolongs the time before the user will receive help.</p>   <p>The human contact mechanism enables a person to express what they are looking for using their own words. For some with cognitive disabilities, this may be the best way for them to find an answer to their problem.</p>   <p>For pages for which no human support is available it helps if a self-help option says that no human support is available. Self-help options can go beyond allowing the user to search within the site. Contextual help is still recommended (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/help">Success Criterion 3.3.5</a> for more information), but a self-help option provides a single location that makes it easier for people with cognitive disabilities to understand what help is available without having to hunt for it. While some people may easily be able to identify that no support would be available for a particular type of Web site, this may not be apparent to some users with disabilities.</p>   <p>Chatbots can work for many people, and particularly for people with cognitive disabilities if they:</p>   <ul>  <li>recognize misspelled words,</li>  <li>provide human contact details if the chatbot is unable to provide a satisfactory response after 3 attempts, and</li>  <li>can be dismissed with a single interaction, and recalled using a link or button.</li>  </ul>   <p>This criterion does not require that a site provide a help mechanism. However, when help is available:</p>  <ul>  <li>People who may have difficulty locating help are more likely to find it and complete their task.</li>  <li>Users that experience cognitive fatigue or cognitive shut down will be able to reserve their energy for the task, instead of using it to find support.</li>  <li>Enabling users (especially those with cognitive disabilities) to find solutions while expressing their question using their own words (for example by interacting with a chatbot) increases their chances of success for completing a task.</li>  </ul>  <p>Self help methods beyond the site, such as using internet search to find the contact information for an organization, can be too difficult. Further, the user's disability may make it more difficult to find the help available (such as a "contact us" link, phone number, or support page) if the information is not consistently present within a few interactions (e.g., displayed in the header, or via a menu). In addition, for some users with disabilities, struggling to complete a task on a site may cause additional cognitive challenges when searching for help within the site.</p>  <p>When a user is quickly able to find help, they are able to complete the task even if they encounter challenges.</p>  </section></blockquote></section></section></section><section id="input-assistance"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x6-3-4-input-assistance">3.3 Input Assistance</h4><a class="self-link" href="#input-assistance" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.3.4"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Help users avoid and correct mistakes.</p></blockquote>

For example, purchasing non-refundable airline tickets or submitting an order to purchase  stock in a brokerage account are financial transactions with serious consequences.  If a user has made a mistake on the date of air travel, he or she could end up with  a ticket for the wrong day that cannot be exchanged.

The autocomplete feature of browsers is not considered sufficient because it is the content (the web site) that needs to provide the stored information for a redundant entry, or avoid asking for the same information again.</p><p>This Success Criterion does not add a requirement to store information between sessions. A <a>process</a> is defined on the basis of an activity and is not applicable when a user returns after closing a session or navigating away. However, a process can run across different domains, so if a check-out process includes a 3rd party payment provider, that would be in scope.</p><p>The term "available to select" is not prescriptive. The term allows authors to develop techniques where auto-population is not possible. It can include allowing the user to:</p><ul>  <li>select and populate a field, including from a drop-down;</li>  <li>select text from the page and copy it into an input;</li>  <li>tick a checkbox to populate inputs with the same values as previously entered (e.g., my billing address is the same as my shipping address).</li>  </ul><p>Data which is "available to select" would need to be on the same page. Ideally, it would be visible by default and closely associated with the input where the data is required. However, it could be elsewhere on a page, including within a show/hide component.</p><p>This Success Criterion does not apply if data is provided by the user with a different method, such as uploading a resume in a document format.</p><p>This Success Criterion does not impact <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication.html">Accessible Authentication</a>, for which allowing auto-filling of passwords is a sufficient technique. In that case the filling is performed by the user's browser. Redundant Entry is asking for the website content to make the previous entry available, but not between sessions or for essential purposes such as asking for a password.</p><p>This criterion does not include requirements or exceptions specific to privacy or personally identifiable information (PII), but when implementing techniques such as auto-population, authors should ensure data protection when storing information even temporarily during a process. It is possible to eliminate redundant entry in ways that do not introduce additional privacy risks, but it is also possible that a poor implementation (for meeting this criterion) could leak additional PII.</p><p>There are exceptions for:</p><ul>  <li>Essential uses of input re-entry for things like memory games which would be invalidated if the previous answers were supplied.</li>  <li>Security measures such as preventing a password string from being shown or copied. When creating a password, it should be a unique and complex string and therefore cannot be validated by the author. If the system requires the user to manually create a password that is not displayed, having users re-validate their new string is allowed as an exception.</li>  <li>When the previously entered information is no longer valid, it can be requested that the user enter that information again.</li>  </ul></blockquote></section></section><section id="accessible-authentication-minimum"><div class="header-wrapper"><h5 id="x6-3-4-7-accessible-authentication-minimum">3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</h5><a class="self-link" href="#accessible-authentication-minimum" aria-label="Permalink for Section 6.3.4.7"></a></div><blockquote class="wcag-quote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A <a>cognitive function test</a> (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication <a>process</a> unless that step provides at least one of the following:</p><dl xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">  <dt>Alternative</dt>  <dd>Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.</dd>  <dt>Mechanism</dt>  <dd>A <a>mechanism</a> is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.</dd>  <dt>Object Recognition</dt>  <dd>The cognitive function test is to recognize objects.</dd>  <dt>Personal Content</dt>  <dd>The cognitive function test is to identify <a>non-text content</a> the user provided to the Web site.</dd>  </dl><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">"Object recognition" and "Personal content" may be represented by images, video, or audio.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">Examples of mechanisms that satisfy this criterion include:  <ol>  <li>support for password entry by password managers to reduce memory need, and</li>  <li>copy and paste to reduce the cognitive burden of re-typing.</li>  </ol>  </div></blockquote>

When authentication relies on performing an action on a separate device, it should be possible to complete the action without the need to transcribe information.

Generally, if the login form meets <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/identify-input-purpose">Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose</a>, and the form controls have an appropriate accessible name in accordance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value">Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>, the user agent should be able to reliably recognize the fields and automatically fill them in. However, if the user agent is actively blocked from filling in the fields (for instance, by a script), then the page would not pass this criterion because it prevents the mechanism from working.</p>  </section><section id="338-accessible-authentication-minimum-section-copy-paste">  <h3 id="338-accessible-authentication-minimum-copy-and-paste">Copy and paste</h3>  <p>Copy and paste can be relied on to avoid transcription. Users can copy their login credentials from a local source (such as a standalone third-party password manager) and paste it into the username and password fields on a login form, or into a web-based command line interfaces asking for a password. Blocking people from pasting into authentication fields, or using a different format between the copied text and the input field (for example, "Enter the 3rd, 4th, and 6th character of your password"), would force the user to transcribe information and therefore fail this criterion, unless another method is available.</p>  </section><section id="338-accessible-authentication-minimum-section-two-factor-authentication">  <h3 id="338-accessible-authentication-minimum-two-factor-authentication-systems-verification-codes">Two-factor authentication systems (verification codes)</h3>  <p>Beyond usernames and passwords, some sites may use two-factor authentication, asking the user to enter a verification code (also called a passcode or one-time password). A service that requires <em>manual</em> transcription of a verification code is not compliant. As with usernames and passwords, it must be possible for a user to at least paste the code (such as from a standalone third-party password manager, text message application, or software-based security key), or to allow user agents to fill in the fields automatically.</p>  <p>There are scenarios where a verification code must be received or generated on a secondary device. For example, authenticating in a web browser on a laptop requires a verification code that is sent as an SMS text message to a mobile phone. However, in most cases, it is possible for the code to then be sent directly to the primary device, where it can then be copied and pasted (for example, by copying the code on the secondary device and emailing it to the primary device, or through the use of a shared cross-device clipboard where copying content on the secondary device makes it available to paste on the primary device). Evaluating whether or not the code can be seamlessly transferred from the secondary device to the primary device is <em>outside of the scope</em> for this Success Criterion. For the purpose of evaluating Web content that relies on authentication using these types of secondary device systems, it is assumed that provisions are in place that make the code available in the user's clipboard. Evaluating this criterion therefore only requires verification that the web content does allow pasting the clipboard content in the related authentication challenge field.</p>  <p>Note that two-factor systems that do not rely on codes — including hardware authentication devices (such as YubiKey), secondary applications (either on the same primary device, or on a secondary device) that expect the user to confirm that it is indeed them trying to log in, and authentication methods provided by the user's operating system (such as Windows Hello, or Touch ID/Face ID on macOS and iOS) — are <em>not</em><a> a cognitive function test</a>.</p>  </section><section id="338-accessible-authentication-minimum-section-object-recognition">  <h3 id="338-accessible-authentication-minimum-object-recognition">Object Recognition</h3>  <p>If a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/">CAPTCHA</a> is used as part of an authentication process, there must be a method that does not include a cognitive function test, unless it meets the exception. If the test is based on something the website has set such as remembering or transcribing a word, or recognizing a picture the website provided, that would be a cognitive functional test. Recognizing objects, or a picture the user has provided is a cognitive function test; however, it is excepted at the AA level.</p>   <p>An object in this context means the general English definition ("a material thing that can be seen and touched") and can include vehicles and animals. If the test goes beyond recognition (e.g. multiply the number cats by the number of dogs), that does not meet the exception.</p>   <p>Some forms of object recognition may require an understanding of a particular culture. For example, taxis can appear differently in different locales. This is an issue for many people, including people with disabilities, but it is not considered an accessibility-specific issue.</p>   <p>Some CAPTCHAs and cognitive function tests used for authentication may only appear in certain situations, such as when ad blockers are present, or after repeated incorrect password entry. This criterion applies when these tests are used regardless of whether they are used every time or only triggered by specific scenarios.</p>   <p>There are a number of technologies that can be employed to prevent scripted abuse of the authentication process.</p>   <ul>  <li><a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-private-access-tokens-01.html#name-rate-limited-access">1.1.1.

Since WCAG 2.0 was published, the specifications (such as HTML) and browsers have improved their handling of parsing errors. It is also the case that assistive technology used to do their own parsing of markup, but now rely on the browser. For that reason this success criterion has been removed. Many issues that would have failed this criterion will fail <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships">Info and Relationships</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value">Name, Role, Value</a>.

If the content cannot be parsed into a data structure, then different user agents may present it differently or be completely unable to parse it. Some user agents use "repair techniques" to render poorly coded content.  </p><p>Since repair techniques vary among user agents, authors cannot assume that content  will be accurately parsed into a data structure or that it will be rendered correctly  by specialized user agents, including assistive technologies, unless the content is  created according to the rules defined in the formal grammar for that technology.  In markup languages, errors in element and attribute syntax and  failure to provide properly nested start/end tags lead to errors that  prevent user agents from parsing the content reliably.  Therefore, the Success Criterion requires that the content can be parsed using only  the rules of the formal grammar.  </p><div class="note">  <p>The concept of "well formed" is close to what is required here. However, exact parsing  requirements vary amongst markup languages, and most non XML-based languages do not  explicitly define requirements for well formedness. Therefore, it was necessary to  be more explicit in the Success Criterion in order to be generally applicable to markup  languages.

These accessibility services enable interoperability between software user interfaces and both assistive technologies and accessibility features of software in standardized ways. Most platform accessibility services go beyond programmatic exposure of name and role, and programmatic setting of states, properties and values (and notification of same), and specify additional information that could be exposed and / or set (for instance, a list of the available actions for a given user interface component, and a means to programmatically execute one of the listed actions).</p></div></div><p></p>

An additional benefit is that assistive technologies for users with cognitive disabilities may achieve an alternative means of indicating (or even delaying or supressing) status messages, as preferred by the user.</p><p>The scope of this Success Criterion is specific to changes in content that involve status messages. A <a>status message</a> is a defined term in WCAG. There are two main criteria that determine whether something meets the definition of a status message:</p><ol>  <li> the message <q>provides information to the user on the success or results of an action, on the waiting state of an application, on the progress of a process, or on the existence of errors;</q></li>  <li> the message is not delivered via a change in context.</li>  </ol><p>Information can be added to pages which does not meet the definition of a status message. For example, the list of results obtained from a search are not considered a status update and thus are not covered by this Success Criterion. However, brief text messages displayed <em>about</em> the completion or status of the search, such as "Searching...", "18 results returned" or "No results returned" would be status updates if they do not take focus. Examples of status messages are given in the section titled <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html#status-examples">Status Message Examples</a> below.</p><p>This Success Criterion specifically addresses scenarios where new content is added to the page without changing the user's context. <a>Changes of context</a>, by their nature, interrupt the user by taking focus. They are already surfaced by assistive technologies, and so have already met the goal to alert the user to new content. As such, messages that involve changes of context do not need to be considered and are not within the scope of this Success Criterion. Examples of scenarios that add new content by changing the context are given in the section titled <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages#excepted-examples">Examples of Changes That Are Not Status Messages</a> below.</p><section id="413-status-messages-section-benefits">  <h3 id="413-status-messages-benefits">Benefits</h3>  <ul>  <li>When appropriate roles or properties are assigned to status messages, the new content is spoken by screen readers in such a way as to assist blind and low vision users. Most sighted users can observe text peripherally added to the viewport. Such content provides additional information without affecting the user's current point of regard. The ability of an assistive technology to announce such new important text content allows more users to benefit from an awareness of the information in an equivalent manner.</li>  <li>Assigning proper roles or properties to status messages provides possible future uses and personalization opportunities, such as the potential to be exploited by assistive technologies created for users with some cognitive disabilities. Where page authors elect to design additions to the screen which do <em>not</em> change the user's context (i.e., take focus), the information is arguably of less importance than something presented using a modal dialog, which must be acknowledged by the user. As such, depending on the user's preferences, an assistive technology may choose to delay, suppress, or transform such messages so a user is not unnecessarily interrupted; or conversely the assistive technology may highlight such messages where the user finds it optimal to do so.</li> </ul>  </section></blockquote></section></section></section></section></section>

Are there platforms were the platform-defined density-independent pixel does not approximate a CSS pixel?

<p>This applies directly as written and as described in the WCAG 2 glossary.</p>

Non-web software and its accompanying platform software do not use CSS pixel measurements. Therefore, use platform-defined density-independent pixel measurements which approximate the CSS reference pixel. Examples of platform-defined density-independent pixel measurements include: points (pt) for iOS and macOS, density-independent pixels (dp) for Android, and effective pixels (epx) for Windows.</div></div>

<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-151"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-144" aria-level="6"><span>Note 2</span></div><div class="">
Examples where a density-independent pixel may not be defined in the platform:

<ul>
<li>Software designed for specific hardware, such as kiosks or office equipment, where the author knows the physical screen size and, potentially, the pixel density.</li>
<li>Software, such as streaming apps on smart TV platforms or similar software, where the author may lack information about the physical screen size but may know an appropriate viewing distance or viewing angle.</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is no platform-defined density-independent pixel measurement, the reference pixel size can be approximated in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine a viewing distance that matches the use case and display type. For instance, in the case of a touchscreen, the viewing distance is normally less than the length of an arm, typically around 28 inches (71 cm).</li>
<li>Calculate the size of the reference pixel: Divide the viewing distance by 2688. The number 2688 is obtained by dividing 28 inches (arm's length) by the derived reference pixel size (1/96 inch). </li></ul></div></div>

Most software and devices are usable at more than one viewing distance. However, only viewing distances that are plausible for the product can be considered an appropriate approximation for the reference pixel. For example, in software designed for use with a touchscreen, a visual-angle pixel longer than 0.11 inch (0.28 mm) would not be plausible, because this would signify a viewing distance of more than arm’s length. </div></div>

People with low vision often use devices at less than the standard viewing distance. However, basing the density-independent pixel on a typical viewing distance provides a balance of benefits for users with disabilities. If a longer viewing distance were chosen as the basis for the density-independent pixel, the viewport would be measured with a smaller number of larger pixels, causing Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow to be less stringent. If a shorter viewing distance were chosen, user interface components would be measured with a larger number of smaller pixels, causing some success criteria, such as 2.5.8 Target Size, to be less stringent. </div></div>

Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality</h2><a class="self-link" href="#success-criteria-problematic-for-closed-functionality" aria-label="Permalink for Appendix A."></a></div>
<div class="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-185"><div role="heading" class="ednote-title marker" id="h-ednote-6" aria-level="3"><span>Editor's note</span></div><div class="">This section has been updated to add notes for new WCAG 2.1 criteria that are problematic for Closed Functionality. 
  
<p>In the next public draft, the WCAG2ICT Task Force will remove obsolete criteria and add new WCAG 2.2 criteria if any are problematic for Closed Functionality. The Task Force may also make updates to existing WCAG 2.0 content in this section to reflect new insights learned since the 2013 WCAG2ICT Note.</p></div></div><p></p>
<p>There are Success Criteria that can be problematic for developers of closed functionality. Some criteria discuss making information available in text (which can be read by assistive technologies), making it “programmatically determinable” (rendered by a user agent and readable by assistive technologies), or doing something else to make content compatible with assistive technologies. Other Success Criteria would apply to systems with closed functionality either if they are partially closed or if they allow for the connection of some types of devices. As an example, Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard would apply to systems which are closed to screen readers, but have a physical keyboard or a connector for standard keyboards. While these criteria, as written, are not always applicable to closed functionality, most of them can inform and aid development of built-in features needed to make closed functionality products accessible. For non-web software on closed functionality products, alternate accessibility provisions might be needed to cover the user needs addressed by the following Success Criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#non-text-content">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a> — Requires text or a text alternative in a programmatically determinable form.</li>
<li><a href="#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded">1.2.1 Pre-recorded video</a> — One of the options available to authors for success criterion 1.2.1 is providing a media alternative that is text which, in the absence of connected assistive technology, would need to be made available in different modalities.</li>
<li><a href="#audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded">1.2.3 Audio description or Media Alternative</a> — One of the options available to authors for success criterion 1.2.3 is providing a media alternative that is text which, in the absence of connected assistive technology, would need to be made available in different modalities.</li>
<li><a href="#info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a> — Requires information in a programmatically determinable form.</li>
<li><a href="#meaningful-sequence">1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence</a> — Requires information in a programmatically determinable form. Instead, a closed functionality software equivalent would be to provide a meaningful reading sequence through auditory output or some other non-visual means that helps users correlate the output with the corresponding information displayed on the screen.</li>
<li><a href="#orientation">1.3.4 Orientation</a> — Closed functionality products that have fixed-in-place displays or other limitations to modifying the physical display orientation are covered under the essential exception and are not required to provide support for orientation changes. See the note in the section <a href="#applying-sc-1-3-4-orientation-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 1.3.4 Identify Input Purpose to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#identify-input-purpose">1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose</a> — Requires information in a programmatically determinable form; in the absence of programmatic capabilities, text labels need to be specific and be provided to the user in other modalities (e.g. auditory).</li>
<li><a href="#audio-control">1.4.2 Audio Control</a> — The intent of this success criterion is to avoid interference of audio with assistive products, which are not available in a system with closed functionality. But if the built-in accessibility features of the closed system provide speech output, then the interference may happen and this SC applies. In addition, there are existing closed functionality requirements in standards such as the EN 301 549 and U.S. Revised 508 Standards (402.3 Volume) that cover volume control for closed functionality products.</li>
<li><a href="#contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a> — There are cases where applying this Success Criterion to non-web software on closed functionality products is problematic:
<ul>
<li>When the contrast of the content is determined by the hardware and not modifiable by the software author, it may not be possible to meet this Success Criterion.
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-186"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-178" aria-level="3"><span>Note 1</span></div><div class="">Hardware requirements for contrast are out of scope for WCAG2ICT (and this Success Criterion).</div></div></li>
<li>When the color contrast ratio cannot be programmatically measured due to system limitations (e.g. lockdown), precise quantifiable testing of color contrast cannot be performed by a third party. In such cases, the software author would need to confirm that the color combinations used meet the contrast requirement.
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-187"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-179" aria-level="3"><span>Note 2</span></div><div class="">Photographs are not sufficient for testing that content meets this Success Criterion. This is because the quality of the lighting, camera, and physical aspects of the hardware display can dramatically affect the ability to capture the content for testing purposes.</div></div></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a>—because the text rendering support in a closed environment may be more limited than the support found in user agents for the Web, meeting Success Criterion 1.4.4 in a closed environment may place a much heavier burden on the content author;</li>
<li><a href="#images-of-text">1.4.5 Images of Text</a>—because there is no need to impose a requirement on all closed functionality that text displayed on the screen actually be represented internally as text (as defined by WCAG 2), given that there is no interoperability with assistive technology;</li>
<li><a href="#reflow">1.4.10 Reflow</a> — Many closed functionality products do not allow users to modify the viewport or change font sizes, so there would be no need to impose a requirement on all closed functionality that content is able to reflow. Additionally, many closed functionality products do not display large chunks of text and only have UI controls; in such cases, two-directional scrolling to access the text and UI controls may be considered essential.</li>
<li><a href="#non-text-contrast">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a> — There are cases where applying this Success Criterion to non-web software on closed functionality products is problematic:
<ul>
<li>When the contrast of the content is determined by the hardware and not modifiable by the software author, it may not be possible to meet this Success Criterion.
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-188"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-180" aria-level="3"><span>Note 3</span></div><div class="">Hardware requirements for contrast are out of scope for WCAG2ICT (and this Success Criterion).</div></div></li>

In such cases, the software author would need to confirm that the color combinations used meet the contrast requirement.

</ul></li>
<li><a href="#text-spacing">1.4.12 Text Spacing</a> — In closed functionality software the ability for users to modify line, paragraph, letter, or word spacing is rarely supported. However, if encountered, the Success Criterion applies as noted in the <a href="#applying-sc-1-4-12-text-spacing-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 1.4.12 Text Spacing to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#keyboard">2.1.1 Keyboard</a>—Requires operation via a keyboard interface which allows alternative input devices. When a product with closed functionality either does not have a standard keyboard or one cannot be connected, it would need an alternate way to access all functionality that does not require accurate pointing, path-based movements, or specific timings.</li>
<li><a href="#bypass-blocks">2.4.1 Bypass Blocks</a> — The WCAG2ICT interpretation of this success criterion replaces "sets of Web pages" with "sets of software programs" which are extremely rare - especially for closed functionality software. However, being able to bypass blocks of content that are repeated within software is generally considered best practice.</li>
<li><a href="#page-titled">2.4.2 Page Titled</a>—Where the software is part of a product that provides a single function, or has a menu-driven interface, there is no need for a title.</li>
<li><a href="#multiple-ways">2.4.5 Multiple Ways</a>—The WCAG2ICT interpretation of this Success Criterion replaces "set of Web pages" with "set of software programs." Such sets, particularly in the context of closed functionality software, are exceedingly rare. There are a number of notes in the section <a href="#applying-sc-2-4-5-multiple-ways-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 2.4.5 Multiple Ways to Non-Web Documents and Software</a> that are applicable to closed functionality software.</li>  
<li><a href="#pointer-cancellation">2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation</a>—As noted in the section <a href="#applying-sc-2-5-2-pointer-cancellation-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>, examples of 'essential' functionality are features for meeting environmental energy usage requirements (like waking a device from sleep, power saver mode, and low power state).</li>  
<li><a href="#label-in-name">2.5.3 Label in Name</a>—Requires information in a programmatically determinable form; specifically, the programmatic name contains the text of the visual label.</li>
<li><a href="#target-size-minimum">2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)</a>—2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) - This Success Criterion uses CSS pixels for defining the target size. Closed functionality may not use CSS pixels as a standard measurement, but the definition of 'CSS pixel' still applies as described in <a href="#applying-css-pixel-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying “CSS pixel” to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>. If the system supports a density-independent pixel measurement, it should be used in place of CSS pixels.

<li><a href="#language-of-page">3.1.1 Language of Page</a>—Requires language information in a programmatically determinable form intended to drive correct pronunciation. Where another mechanism achieves correct pronunciation for closed functionality, such as self-voicing, the intent of this success criterion would be met.</li>
<li><a href="#language-of-parts">3.1.2 Language of Parts</a>—Requires language information in a programmatically determinable form intended to drive correct pronunciation. Where another mechanism achieves correct pronunciation for closed functionality, such as self-voicing, the intent of this success criterion would be met.</li>
<li><a href="#consistent-navigation">3.2.3 Consistent Navigation</a>—This Success Criterion is interpreted to only apply to "sets of software programs" which are very rare. See the second note in the section <a href="#applying-sc-3-2-3-consistent-navigation-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>

See the second note in the section <a href="#applying-sc-3-2-4-consistent-identification-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 3.2.4 Consistent Identification to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#error-identification">3.3.1 Error Identification</a>—while it's important for errors that can be detected to be described to the user, for closed functionality, the error description doesn't have to be provided in text, as defined in WCAG 2;</li>
<li><a href="#accessible-authentication-minimum">3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</a>—There are situations where meeting this success criterion is problematic:</li>
<ul>
<li>Systems that are designed for shared use (such as in a public library) or have closed functionality might block mechanisms typically used to assist the user, such as copying authentication information from a password manager. Instead, an alternative authentication method might be helpful, such as an identity card scanner.</li>
<li>Where standards for banking or security have authentication requirements that are regulated or strictly enforced, those requirements may be judged to take legal precedence over Success Criterion 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum).</li>
</ul>  
<li><a href="#name-role-value">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>—requires information in a programmatically determinable form.</li>
<li><a href="#status-messages">4.1.3 Status Messages</a>—requires information in a programmatic determinable form. Additionally, software with closed functionality is not typically implemented using markup languages.

<p>The interface of a text application is realized through a server application directing which characters should be placed on the screen, along with either a hardware terminal or a terminal application that displays the characters. The client terminal application for text applications is analogous to a web user agent for web pages. Also like web applications, text applications may execute primarily on a remote server or execute locally.</p>
<p>Some text applications render like a TeleTYpewriter (TTY); their output is always appended, like an ever growing file. Such text applications are often called “command-line applications” or occasionally “TTY-applications”, and their output can optionally be redirected to a file for later review. Others explicitly place text into a matrix of fixed width character cells on a screen (sometimes with specific foreground and background colors).</p>
<p>Historically, input to the text application itself is provided exclusively through a keyboard interface, though Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based voice input is sometimes now an alternative option - especially on mobile devices.</p>
</section><section id="how-text-applications-have-been-made-accessible-via-assistive-technology"><div class="header-wrapper"><h3 id="b-2-how-text-applications-have-been-made-accessible-via-assistive-technology">B.2 How text applications have been made accessible via assistive technology</h3><a class="self-link" href="#how-text-applications-have-been-made-accessible-via-assistive-technology" aria-label="Permalink for Appendix B.2"></a></div>
<p>Strategies for making text applications accessible through assistive technology involve two key tasks: (1) obtaining all of the text displayed in the interface, and (2) performing an analysis on that text to detect screen updates and attempt to discern structural elements.</p>
<p>For example, a text application screen reader might directly access the matrix of character cells in the interface and provide a screen review mechanism for the user to review that matrix of characters (by sending the output to synthetic speech and/or a braille display). Alternately, a text application screen reader might directly consume the output rendered (perhaps by acting as its own terminal application or by analyzing the “TTY” output). A text application screen reader might also attempt to analyze the spacing and layout of the text in the matrix, to provide features such as reading columns of text in a multi-column layout; discerning headers through analysis of line spacing, indentation, and capitalization; and discerning input fields or user interface components by scanning for the use of inverse video, for text appearing in brackets, or for text from the character graphics codepage (ASCII codes greater than ‘0x7F’). Some of this analysis might also be done through the use of filter tools that transform the output of a program (e.g., through reformatting “TTY” output rendered to a file or as direct input to a filter tool).</p>
<p>Similarly, a text application screen magnifier would gain access to the matrix of character cells to magnify them or re-display them in a larger font. It would scan for screen refreshes and updates and then apply heuristics to what had changed in order to decide what sub-matrix of character cells should appear in a magnified view. It would also scan for inverse video and a moving text cursor to track text being input by the user (and might combine the text matrix scanning with scanning of the keyboard input to match user input to what is appearing on the screen).</p>
</section><section id="applying-wcag-2-to-text-applications"><div class="header-wrapper"><h3 id="b-3-applying-wcag-2-to-text-applications">B.3 Applying WCAG 2 to text applications</h3><a class="self-link" href="#applying-wcag-2-to-text-applications" aria-label="Permalink for Appendix B.3"></a></div>
<p>To apply WCAG to text applications, it is necessary to apply the glossary terms <a href="#dfn-accessibility-supported">accessibility supported</a> and <a href="#dfn-programmatically-determined">programmatically determined</a> in the context of how text applications are rendered and the history of assistive technologies that made them accessible.</p>
<p>As noted above, in a text interface the terminal application renders the characters on the screen, just as a Web browser typically renders content for a Web application. As an example, for success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a>, a text application could achieve 200 percent resizing when the terminal application client that is rendering it has this capability (cf. WCAG 2 Technique <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G142">G142 Using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that support zoom</a>). Many web pages and web applications use this approach to meet success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a> through no explicit action of their own.</p>
<p>A similar approach could also be used for success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (minimum)</a> (cf. WCAG 2 Technique <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G148">G148: Not specifying background color, not specifying text color, and not using technology features that change those defaults</a>): relying on the terminal application client to render the text with sufficient contrast against the background. In fact, many terminal applications allow the user to force all text to share a single user-chosen foreground color (and a single user-chosen background color), overriding the text application's specified colors to meet the user's desires or needs.</p>
<p>Since many assistive technology analysis techniques depend upon discerning the location of the text input cursor, terminal application use of “soft cursors” and “highlight bars” may bypass those analysis techniques and cause failures of success criteria.</p>
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-193"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-185" aria-level="4"><span>Note 1</span></div><div class="">It is outside of the scope of this document to define WCAG techniques for non-web ICT. These examples are simply illustrations of how WCAG 2 success criteria can be applied to this class of non-web software applications.</div></div>

<p>The way to think about "accessibility supported" and "programmatically determined" may seem a little different for text applications, but the definitions are unchanged. Unlike the semantic objects of graphical user interfaces and web pages, the output of text-based applications consists of plain text. A terminal emulator acts as the user agent for text-based applications; it might render some content such as escape codes as semantic elements, but otherwise exposes only lines of text to assistive technology. Where assistive technology is able to interpret the text and any semantic objects accurately, the content is "programmatically determinable"—even though no explicit markup was necessarily used to make it so.</p>
