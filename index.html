<p>This document is an update to a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr#WGNote">Working Group Note</a> to incorporate new guidelines, success criteria, and definitions added in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-wcag2ict-20130905/">Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)</a>, approved in September 2013, described how WCAG 2.0 could be applied to non-web documents and software. WCAG2ICT was organized to mirror WCAG's sections: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.  WCAG2ICT clarified when and how WCAG success criteria could be applied to non-web documents and software.  Some were applicable without modification and some were applicable with edits and/or notes.  Glossary terms were also reviewed. Level AAA success criteria were not addressed in the 2013 WCAG2ICT Working Group Note. </p>
<p>The 2013 WCAG2ICT has been relied upon in regulations and legislation.  One example is [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-en-301-549" title="ETSI EN 301 549 V3.2.1 (2021-03): Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services">etsi-en-301-549</a></cite>] (Europe) and other standards that reference or incorporate EN 301 549 (e.g., India, Kenya, Australia).  Another example is Section 508 (U.S.) <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/18/2017-00395/information-and-communication-technology-ict-standards-and-guidelines#h-36">Application of WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web ICT</a>, which looked to WCAG2ICT for detailed direction with providing specific guidance and exceptions to particular criteria from being applied to non-web technology.  Section 508 incorporated by reference WCAG as the <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#E205.4">Accessibility Standard applicable to non-web documents</a> and requires <a href="https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#E207.2">WCAG Conformance for non-web software</a>.</p>

<p>This document provides informative guidance (guidance that is not <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-normative">normative</a> and that does not set requirements) with regard to the interpretation and application of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT). This document is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#WGNote">Working Group Note</a> (in contrast to WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1, and WCAG 2.2, which are <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Recommendations).  Specifically, this document provides informative guidance on applying WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 Level A and AA success criteria to non-web ICT, specifically to non-web documents and software.  </p>
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note" aria-level="4"><span>Note 1</span></div><div class="">Hereafter, the use of WCAG 2 means all WCAG 2.x versions — 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2.</div></div>

<p>This document is intended to help clarify how to use WCAG 2 to make non-web documents and software more accessible to people with disabilities. Addressing accessibility involves addressing the needs of people with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual impairments, as well as accessibility needs of people due to the effects of aging. Although WCAG 2 addresses some user needs for people with cognitive and learning disabilities as well as mental health related disabilities, following the WCAG supplement <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/">Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</a> is recommended for non-web ICT to address the user needs of these groups. Developers are also encouraged to obtain testing input from persons with disabilities using applications and content.</p>
<p>Although this document covers a wide range of issues, it is not able to address all the needs of all people with disabilities. Since WCAG 2 was developed for the Web, addressing accessibility for non-web documents and software may involve requirements and considerations beyond those included in this document. Authors and developers are encouraged to seek relevant advice about current best practices to ensure that non-web documents and software are accessible, as much as possible, to people with disabilities. The following supporting documents contain helpful information to learn about the user needs, intent, and generalized implementation techniques to support a wider range of people with disabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG 2 Overview</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/">Techniques for WCAG 2.2</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-wcag22-techs" title="Techniques for WCAG 2.2">WCAG22-TECHS</a></cite>]</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/">How to Meet WCAG (Quick Reference)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/ag/publications/">Additional Accessibility Guidelines Working Group - Publications</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While WCAG 2 was designed to be technology-neutral, it assumes the presence of a “user agent” such as a browser, media player, or assistive technology as a means to access web content. As a result, the application of WCAG 2 to documents and software in non-web contexts necessitates some interpretation in order to determine how the intent of each WCAG 2 success criterion could be met in these different contexts of use. Therefore, the bulk of the Task Force's work involved evaluating how each WCAG 2 success criterion would apply in the context of non-web ICT, if it were applied to non-web ICT.</p>
<p>The Task Force found that the majority of success criteria from WCAG 2 can be applied to non-web documents and software with either no or minimal changes. Since many of the Level A and AA success criteria do not include any web-related terms, they apply directly as written and as described in the “Intent” sections from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/">Understanding WCAG 2.2</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-understanding-wcag22" title="Understanding Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2">UNDERSTANDING-WCAG22</a></cite>] resource. Additional notes were provided, as needed, to provide assistance in applying them to non-web documents and software.</p>
<section id="interpretation-of-web-terminology-in-a-non-web-context"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x1-2-1-interpretation-of-web-terminology-in-a-non-web-context">Interpretation of Web Terminology in a Non-Web Context</h4><a class="self-link" href="#interpretation-of-web-terminology-in-a-non-web-context" aria-label="Permalink for Section Interpretation of Web Terminology in a Non-Web Context"></a></div>
<p>When certain web-specific terms or phrases like “web page(s)” were used in success criteria, those were replaced with non-web terms or phrases like “non-web document(s) and software”. Additional notes were also provided to explain the terminology replacements.</p>
<p>A small number of success criteria are written to apply to “a set of web pages” or “multiple web pages” and depend upon all pages in the set to share some characteristic or behavior. Since the unit of conformance in WCAG 2 is a single web page, the task force agreed that the equivalent unit of conformance for non-web documents is a single document. It follows that an equivalent unit of evaluation for a “set of web pages” would be a “set of documents”. Since it isn't possible to unambiguously carve up non-web software into discrete pieces, a single “web page” was equated to a “software program” and a “set of web pages” was equated to a “set of software programs”.&nbsp; Both of these terms are defined in the Key Terms section of this document. See “<a href="#set-of-documents">set of documents</a>” and “<a href="#set-of-software-programs">set of software programs</a>” to determine when a group of documents or pieces of software are considered a set. </p>
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-0"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-0" aria-level="5"><span>Note</span></div><div class="">Sets of non-web software that meet this definition appear to be extremely rare.</div></div>

<p>Not all success criteria have been fully adopted in all local regulations and legislation, and may not be applicable to all technologies. WCAG2ICT has been used in some regulations to determine whether or not to apply certain success criteria. For example, some local standards such as Section 508 in the U.S., and EN 301 549 in Europe, state that WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks, 2.4.5 Multiple Ways, 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation, and 3.2.4 Consistent Identification do not apply to non-web documents and non-web software. In addition, EN 301 549 also states that 2.4.2 Page Titled and 3.1.2 Language of Parts do not apply to non-web software. In contrast, the U.S. Department of Justice regulation Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability; Accessibility of Web Information and Services of State and Local Government Entities (89 FR 31320, 24 April 2024) directs implementers to utilize the guidance in this document to determine the applicability and how to apply the requirements to mobile applications. Since this document does not specifically say which criteria can or should apply, those implementing this document (WCAG2ICT) should consider the applicability of individual success criteria to non-web documents and software.</p>
<p>The glossary terms were also reviewed and most of them applied to non-web documents and software, as written. Some applied with additional notes or edits (largely related to phrases like “web page(s)”), and a small number of terms were only used in Level AAA success criteria which are not addressed by the WCAG2ICT Note at this time.</p>

<p>The following are out of scope for this document:</p>
<ul>
<li>This document does not seek to determine which WCAG 2 provisions (principles, guidelines, or success criteria) should or should not apply to non-web documents and software, but rather how they would apply, if applied.</li>
<li>This document does not propose changes to WCAG 2 or its supporting documents; it does not include interpretations for implementing WCAG 2 in web technologies. During the development of this document, the WCAG2ICT Task Force did seek clarification on the intent of a number of the success criteria, which led to clarifications in the Understanding WCAG 2 document.</li>
<li>This document is not sufficient by itself to ensure accessibility in non-web documents and software. As a web standard, WCAG does not fully cover all accessibility requirements for non-user interface aspects of platforms, user-interface components as individual items, or ICT with closed functionality (where there is no assistive technology to communicate programmatic information).</li>
<li>This document does not comment on hardware aspects of products, because the basic constructs on which WCAG 2 is built do not apply to these.</li>
<li>This document does not provide supporting techniques for implementing WCAG 2 in non-web documents and software.</li>
<li>This document is purely an informative Note about non-web ICT, not a standard, so it does not describe how non-web ICT should conform to it.</li>

<p>WCAG2ICT provides some key glossary terms to address differences between web and non-web contexts and to introduce terms that are nonexistent in WCAG but important to define for a non-web context. “Content” and “user agent” are glossary terms from WCAG 2 that need to be interpreted significantly differently when applied to non-web ICT. The glossary term “web page” in WCAG 2 is replaced with the defined terms “document” and “software”, and both “set of web pages” and “multiple web pages” are replaced with the defined terms “set of documents” and “set of software programs”. The terms introduced by WCAG2ICT are “accessibility services of platform software” because non-web software doesn't leverage the WCAG notion of a user agent, and "closed functionality" which is specific to non-web software. The remaining glossary terms from WCAG 2 are addressed in <a href="#comments-on-definitions-in-wcag-2-glossary">Chapter 7 Comments on Definitions in WCAG 2 Glossary</a>. Terms defined and used in WCAG2ICT are applicable only to the interpretation of the guidance in this document. The particular definitions should not be interpreted as having applicability to situations beyond the scope of WCAG2ICT. Further information on usage of these terms follows.</p>

<p>The term <strong>accessibility services of platform software</strong>, as used in WCAG2ICT, has the meaning below:</p>
<dl><dt>accessibility services of platform software (as used in WCAG2ICT)</dt><dd>

<p>services provided by an operating system, <a href="#user-agent">user agent</a>, or other <a href="#platform-software">platform software</a> that enable non-web <a href="#document">documents</a> or <a href="#software">software</a> to expose information about the user interface and events to assistive technologies and accessibility features of software

<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-1"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-1" aria-level="4"><span>Note</span></div><div class="">

<p>These services are commonly provided in the form of accessibility APIs (application programming interfaces), and they provide two-way communication with assistive technologies, including exposing information about objects and events.</p></div></div><p></p>
</section><section id="closed-functionality"><div class="header-wrapper"><h3 id="x2-2-closed-functionality">Closed Functionality</h3><a class="self-link" href="#closed-functionality" aria-label="Permalink for Section Closed Functionality"></a></div>
<p>The term <strong>closed functionality</strong>, as used in WCAG2ICT, has the meaning below:</p>
<dl><dt>closed functionality (as used in WCAG2ICT)</dt><dd>

<p>a property or characteristic that prevents users from attaching, installing, or using <a href="#dfn-assistive-technologies">assistive technology</a></p></dd></dl><p></p>
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-2"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-2" aria-level="4"><span>Note 1</span></div><div class="">

<p>To support users with disabilities, ICT with closed functionality might instead provide built-in features that function as assistive technology or use other mechanisms to make the technology accessible.</p></div></div>
<div class="example">

<p><span>Example: </span>Examples of technology that may have closed functionality include but are not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>self-service transaction machines or kiosks — examples include machines used for retail self-checkout, point of sales (POS) terminals, ticketing and self-check-in, and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs).</li>
<li>telephony devices such as internet phones, feature phones, smartphones, and phone-enabled tablets</li>
<li>educational devices such as interactive whiteboards and smart boards</li>
<li>entertainment technologies including gaming platforms or consoles, smart TVs, set-top boxes, smart displays, smart speakers, smart watches, and tablets</li>
<li>an ebook reader or standalone ebook software that allows assistive technologies to access all of the user interface controls of the ebook program (open functionality) but does not allow the assistive technologies to access the actual content of book (closed functionality).</li>
<li>medical devices such as digital blood pressure monitors, glucose meters, or other wearable devices</li>
<li>an operating system that makes the user provide login credentials before it allows any assistive technologies to be loaded. The login portion would be closed functionality.</li>
<li>other technology devices, such as printers, displays, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices</li></ul></div>

<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-3"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-3" aria-level="4"><span>Note 2</span></div><div class="">
  
<p>Some of these technologies, though closed to some external assistive technologies, often have extensive internal accessibility features that serve as assistive technology that can be used by applications on these devices in the same way assistive technology is used on fully open devices, such as desktop computers. Others are open to some types of assistive technology but not others.</p></div></div><p></p>

<p>WCAG 2 defines <strong>content</strong> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-agents">user agent</a>, including code or markup that defines the content's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-structure">structure</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-presentation">presentation</a>, and interactions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For non-web content it is necessary to view this a bit more broadly. Within WCAG2ICT, the term “content” is used as follows:</p>
<dl><dt>content (non-web content) (as used in WCAG2ICT)</dt><dd>

<p>information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of <strong><ins>[<a href="#software">software</a>]</ins></strong>, including code or markup that defines the content's <a href="#dfn-structure">structure</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-presentation">presentation</a>, and interactions

<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-4"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-4" aria-level="4"><span>Note 1</span></div><div class="">

<p>Non-web content occurs in two places; documents and software. When content occurs in a non-web document, a user agent is needed in order to communicate the content's information and sensory experience to the user. When content occurs in non-web software, a separate user agent isn't needed — the software itself performs that function.</p></div></div><p></p>
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-5"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-5" aria-level="4"><span>Note 2</span></div><div class="">

<p>Content from a third party needs special consideration since sometimes it may be under the control of the author (e.g. contracted and therefore may not be considered 3rd party) and sometimes it is completely out of the control of the author (e.g. email in an email client).</p></div></div><p></p>
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-6"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-6" aria-level="4"><span>Note 3</span></div><div class="">

If and where software retrieves “information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user” from such files, it is just another part of the content that occurs in software and is covered by WCAG2ICT like any other parts of the software.

<p>Although the term “software” is used throughout this document because this would apply to stand-alone software programs as well as individual software components and the software components in software-hardware combinations, the concept of “set of software programs” would only apply (by definition) to programs that can be launched separately from each other. Therefore, in the WCAG2ICT guidance for the provisions that use the phrase “set of” (success criteria 2.4.1, 2.4.5, 3.2.3, 3.2.4, and 3.2.6), the phrase “set of software programs” is used.</p></div></div><p></p>

<ul>
<li>A suite of programs for authoring different types of documents (text, spreadsheets, presentations, etc.) where the programs don't provide an explicit, consistent means to launch, or switch to, each of the other programs in the group.</li>
<li>An office package consisting of multiple programs that launches as a single program that provides multiple functionalities such as writing, spreadsheet, etc., but the only way to navigate between programs is to open a document in one of the programs.</li>
<li>A bundle of software programs that is sold together but the only way to navigate between the programs in the bundle is to use a platform software level menu to navigate between them (and not via a menu provided by each program that allows you to navigate to just the other programs in this bundle).</li>
<li>A group of programs that was a set, but the programs have been moved to separate locations so that their “set” behaviors were disrupted and no longer work. Even though they <em>were</em> a set at one time, because they are no longer installed as a set they no longer <em>are</em> a set and would not need to meet any success criteria that apply to sets of software.</li></ul></div>

<p>Because software with a user interface provides a function equivalent to a user agent in addition to content, the application of some WCAG 2 success criteria would be different for content embedded in software versus content in a document, where it is viewed through a separate user agent (e.g. browser, player, viewer, etc.).</p></div></div><p></p>

<p>WCAG 2 defines <strong>user agent</strong> as:</p>
<blockquote>
any software that retrieves and presents web content for users

<p><span>Example: </span>Web browsers, media players, plug-ins, and other programs — including <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag22/#dfn-assistive-technologies">assistive technologies</a> — that help in retrieving, rendering, and interacting with web content.</p></div><p></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For non-web ICT, “user agent” needs to be viewed differently. In WCAG 2, the term “user agent” only refers to retrieval and display of web content. For non-web ICT, the term “user agent” refers to retrieval and display of separate content that is <em>not on the web</em>, which WCAG2ICT refers to as a “document”. Within WCAG2ICT, the term “user agent” is used as follows:</p>
<dl><dt>user agent (as used in WCAG2ICT)</dt><dd>

<p>As noted in the Introduction, WCAG 2 assumes the presence of a “user agent” such as a browser, media player, or assistive technology as a means to access web content. Many of the success criteria in WCAG 2 assume web content will be accessed by ICT where assistive technologies can be connected to it or installed on it. The assistive technologies then present the web content to people with disabilities in an accessible form. </p>
<p>ICT with <a href="#closed-functionality">closed functionality</a> does not allow the use of some assistive technologies for some or all of the ICT's functions. In many cases, such ICT also lacks a “user agent” or its equivalent. To the extent the ICT is closed, following the WCAG success criteria by themselves will not ensure that non-web software is accessible. Where the wide range of assistive technologies or user agents are not available, as they are for web content, to address the intent of these success criteria, something else needs to be provided or be required to facilitate accessibility as intended by WCAG 2. It is outside the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2ict/work-statement/">WCAG2ICT Task Force Work Statement</a> to say what additional measures are needed, but WCAG2ICT points out which success criteria depend on assistive technologies — and therefore which success criteria would be problematic in the context of ICT with closed functionality.</p>
<div class="example">

<p><span>Example: </span>In developing guidance for ICT with closed functionality, the task force has considered specific examples of ICT that historically have been partially or fully closed to assistive technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>self-service transaction machines or kiosks (e.g. retail self-checkout, point of sales (POS) terminals, and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs))</li>
<li>telephony devices (e.g. internet phones, feature phones, and smartphones)</li>
<li>entertainment technologies (e.g. smart TV, set-top box, smart watches)</li>
<li>ebook reader</li>
<li>computer that is locked down due to a policy so that users may not adjust settings or install software</li>
<li>other technology devices (e.g. printers, displays, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices).</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples are explained more fully in the definition of <a href="#closed-functionality">closed functionality</a> in the Key Terms section.</p>
</div>

<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-33"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-33" aria-level="3"><span>Note</span></div><div class="">

<p>Some of these technologies, though closed to some external assistive technologies, often have extensive internal accessibility features that serve as assistive technology that can be used by applications on these devices in the same way assistive technology is used on fully open devices, such as desktop computers. Others are open to some types of assistive technology but not others.</p></div></div><p></p>
<p>There are existing standards that specify accessibility requirements for both hardware and software aspects of ICT with closed functionality. This document does not comment on those standards, but does note that WCAG success criteria should not be applied to hardware aspects of ICT with closed functionality. WCAG2ICT does provide considerations for applying WCAG success criteria to non-web software on ICT with closed functionality. WCAG2ICT also indicates where and why success criteria might be problematic for non-web software due to the underlying assumptions built into the WCAG success criteria. See <a href="#success-criteria-problematic-for-closed-functionality">Appendix A: Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality</a> for a list of success criteria for which this is relevant.</p>

<p>Text applications are a class of software ICT that appeared decades ago, prior to the emergence of the graphical user interface (GUI) and the Web. The interface of a text application is generated using only text characters, and either a hardware terminal or a software terminal application handles the rendering of the text application—similar to how a web user agent handles the rendering of a web application. Text applications only accept text input, though some may also support the use of a mouse or other input devices. More recently, terminal applications that render text applications in the GUI may utilize spoken input through Automated Speech Recognition (ASR). Both GUI and native text environment interfaces also now commonly support word-completion prediction technologies. Command-line applications are a subset of text applications with further specific properties.</p>
<p>Historically, assistive technologies developed alongside text applications, making it possible for text applications to be accessible. Although there are far fewer new text applications being developed compared to new GUI or web applications, text applications remain in use today. In fact, command-line interfaces have seen a resurgence in recent years, especially in popular programming and revision-tracking environments with continued development and greater functionality. In some cases this has precipitated renewed developments in assistive technology support for text applications.</p>
<p>Assistive technology support continues to evolve in today's text applications. Key examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In command line interfaces (CLI), support often includes context-sensitive help, so that help output following one command argument is different from the help provided following two arguments, and different still after three arguments. This helps users be more efficient and places no new requirements on assistive technologies.</li>
<li>Output options generally include machine-readable structured text formats (such as JSON), in addition to the still powerful and widely used options of input/output redirection and piping. In these scenarios the assistive technology user can make use of the same range of output options as anyone else who finds the CLI environment compelling.</li>
</ul>
<p>As noted in <a href="#background-on-text-command-line-terminal-applications-and-interfaces">Appendix B. Background on Text / Command-Line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces</a>, applying WCAG to text / command-line applications involves understanding how text applications are rendered, how text applications have been made accessible via assistive technologies, and how to apply the concepts of “accessibility supported” and “programmatically determined” to text applications.</p>

<p>WCAG2ICT is not a standard, so it is not possible to conform to WCAG2ICT. However, some entities may wish to use the information in WCAG2ICT to help establish standards or regulations regarding accessibility in ICT that are based on WCAG 2. While such standards or regulations will need to address matters of conformance themselves, the following notes may be of assistance to those wishing to apply WCAG 2 to non-web documents and software:</p>
<ol>
<li>The WCAG 2 success criteria and the conformance requirements were designed to work together, such that the language of the success criteria is based on the nature of the conformance requirements. The choice of what level to use for a given criteria (A vs. AA vs. AAA) was further influenced by a number of factors specific to the web domain, as set forth in <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#levels">Understanding Levels of Conformance</a>.</li>
<li>In the WCAG 2 conformance model, a <a href="#dfn-satisfies">success criterion is satisfied</a> if the item being evaluated does not fail it. If the success criterion is in relation to something that does not exist for the item being evaluated (e.g. a success criterion is about captioning audio and there is no audio), where some might consider the criterion "not applicable", the success criterion is automatically met. This approach is central to the way the success criteria in WCAG are structured and worded.</li>
<li>WCAG 2 conformance is applied to the item being evaluated (i.e., a web page) as a whole, except when a process includes use of several items, in which case all of the items that are needed in order to complete the process must conform.</li>
<li>In WCAG 2, when conformance depends upon accessibility features of the platform (i.e., a browser for web content) or on assistive technologies, WCAG 2 requires that there are assistive technologies, etc. that work with the product (web page).  That is, conformance with WCAG 2 requires that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#cc4">only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies</a> are relied upon to satisfy the success criteria.</li>
<li>WCAG 2 allows information on part of a page to not conform if the same information is available elsewhere on the page in a conforming fashion. However, WCAG 2 identifies four success criteria that must be met on all areas of the page because they can interfere with the user's ability to access and use other parts of the page:<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#audio-control">1.4.2 Audio Control</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#no-keyboard-trap">2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#pause-stop-hide">2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#three-flashes-or-below-threshold">2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, as noted in the Introduction, it wasn't possible to unambiguously carve up software into discrete pieces, and so the unit of evaluation for non-web software is the whole software program. As with any software testing, this can be a very large unit of evaluation, and methods similar to standard software testing may be needed.</p>

<p>When the underlying user agent or platform does not support these dimensions for scrolling, reflow is encouraged as this capability is important to people with low vision.

<p>The intent section refers to the ability for content to reflow (for vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels, or for horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels) when user agent zooming is used to scale content or when the <a href="#dfn-viewport">viewport</a> changes in width. For <a href="#software">non-web software</a>, this means that when users scale content, adjust the size of a window, dialog, or other resizable content area, or change the screen resolution, the content will reflow without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions; or that the application works with platform features that satisfy this success criterion.</p></div></div><p></p>

<p>Non-web software will have more frequent cases where two-dimensional layout is relied upon for usage or meaning than what occurs on the Web. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the non-web software has a complex user interface with toolbars that need to be visible while manipulating content, as explained in the Intent from Understanding 1.4.10 Reflow.</li></ul></div></div><div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-68"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-68" aria-level="7"><span>Note 8 (Added) (for non-web software)</span></div><div class="wcag2ict software">

<p>When the underlying user agent or platform does not support these dimensions for scrolling, reflow is encouraged as this capability is important to people with low vision. As a reasonable benchmark, evaluate at the nearest size to what the Reflow success criterion specifies.</p>
<p>When users modify zoom, scaling, and/or display resolution at the platform software level (e.g. Operating System), it impacts the size of all applications and the <a href="#platform-software">platform software</a> itself.

<p>Some non-web software applications provide a mode of operation where reflow is possible, while other modes are unable to reflow. An example is a document authoring tool, which includes both a "print preview mode" (without reflow, for users to view the spatial formatting) and a "drafting view mode" where reflow is supported. Such software would satisfy this success criterion as long as there is no loss of information or functionality in the drafting view.</p></div></div><p></p>

<p>The definitions of “<a href="#set-of-documents">set of documents</a>” and “<a href="#set-of-software-programs">set of software programs</a>” in the Key Terms section are predicated on the ability to navigate from each element of the set to each other, and navigation is a type of locating. So the mechanism used to navigate between elements of the set will be one way of locating information in the set. Non-web environments, generally major operating systems with browse and search capabilities, often provide infrastructure and tools that provide mechanisms for locating content in a set of non-web documents or a set of software programs. For example, it may be possible to browse through the files or programs that make up a set, or search within members of the set for the names of other members. A file directory would be the equivalent of a site map for documents in a set, and a search function in a file system would be equivalent to a web search function for web pages. Such facilities may provide additional ways of locating information in the set.</p></div></div><p></p>

<p>The distinction between <ins><strong>[mainstream ICTs]</strong></ins> and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many <ins><strong>[mainstream ICTs]</strong></ins> provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that <ins><strong>[mainstream ICTs]</strong></ins> target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The <ins><strong>[mainstream ICT]</strong></ins> may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving <ins><strong>[<a href="#content-on-and-off-the-web">content</a>]</strong></ins> from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.</p></div></div><p></p>

<li>screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;</li>
<li>text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;</li>

Examples where a density-independent pixel may not be defined in the platform:

<ul>
<li>Software designed for specific hardware, such as kiosks or office equipment, where the author knows the physical screen size and, potentially, the pixel density.</li>
<li>Software, such as streaming apps on smart TV platforms or similar software, where the author may lack information about the physical screen size but may know an appropriate viewing distance or viewing angle.</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is no platform-defined density-independent pixel measurement, the reference pixel size can be approximated in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine a viewing distance that matches the use case and display type. For instance, in the case of a touchscreen, the viewing distance is normally less than the length of an arm, typically around 28 inches (71 cm).</li>
<li>Calculate the size of the reference pixel: Divide the viewing distance by 2688. The number 2688 is obtained by dividing 28 inches (arm's length) by the derived reference pixel size (1/96 inch). </li></ul></div></div>

Most software and devices are usable at more than one viewing distance. However, only viewing distances that are plausible for the product can be considered an appropriate approximation for the reference pixel. For example, in software designed for use with a touchscreen, a visual-angle pixel longer than 0.11 inch (0.28 mm) would not be plausible, because this would signify a viewing distance of more than arm’s length. </div></div>

People with low vision often use devices at less than the standard viewing distance. However, basing the density-independent pixel on a typical viewing distance provides a balance of benefits for users with disabilities. If a longer viewing distance were chosen as the basis for the density-independent pixel, the viewport would be measured with a smaller number of larger pixels, causing success criterion 1.4.10 Reflow to be less stringent. If a shorter viewing distance were chosen, user interface components would be measured with a larger number of smaller pixels, causing some success criteria, such as 2.5.8 Target Size, to be less stringent. </div></div>

<p>This Working Group Note does not introduce any new privacy considerations.

		<section class="appendix" id="success-criteria-problematic-for-closed-functionality"><div class="header-wrapper"><h2 id="a-success-criteria-problematic-for-closed-functionality">A. Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality</h2><a class="self-link" href="#success-criteria-problematic-for-closed-functionality" aria-label="Permalink for Section A. Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality"></a></div>
<p>There are success criteria that can be problematic for developers of ICT with closed functionality.  Some criteria discuss making information available in text (which can be read by assistive technologies), making it “programmatically determinable” (rendered by a user agent and readable by assistive technologies), or doing something else to make content compatible with assistive technologies.  Where ICT with closed functionality doesn’t support use of assistive technology or the platform does not have an accessibility API, providing equivalent information and operation through another mechanism, such as functions built into the software that behave like assistive technology, would help meet the intent of these success criteria. See also the <a href="#comments-on-closed-functionality">Comments on Closed Functionality</a> section.</p>
<p>Other success criteria would apply to ICT with closed functionality either if they are partially closed or if they allow for the connection of some types of devices. As an example, Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard would apply to ICT that is closed to screen readers, but have a physical keyboard, a connector for standard keyboards, or allow the installation of alternate keyboards.  While these criteria, as written, are not always applicable to ICT with closed functionality, most of them can inform and aid development of built-in features needed to make ICT with closed functionality accessible. </p>
<p>For non-web software on ICT with closed functionality, those who implement this document (WCAG2ICT) should consider the applicability of individual WCAG 2 success criteria on a criterion-by-criterion basis. Alternate accessibility provisions might be needed to cover the user needs addressed by the following success criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#non-text-content">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a> — Depends upon text (or a text alternative) being in a programmatically determinable form.</li>
<li><a href="#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded">1.2.1 Pre-recorded video</a> — One of the options available to authors for Success Criterion 1.2.1 is providing a media alternative that is text which, in the absence of connected assistive technology, would need to be made available in different modalities.</li>
<li><a href="#audio-description-or-media-alternative-prerecorded">1.2.3 Audio description or Media Alternative</a> — One of the options available to authors for Success Criterion 1.2.3 is providing a media alternative that is text which, in the absence of connected assistive technology, would need to be made available in different modalities.</li>
<li><a href="#info-and-relationships">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a> — Requires that information be in a programmatically determinable form or in text (that is programmatically determinable).</li>
<li><a href="#meaningful-sequence">1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence</a> — Requires information (i.e, a correct reading sequence) in a programmatically determinable form.  An equivalent for ICT with closed functionality would be to provide a meaningful reading sequence through auditory output or some other non-visual means that helps users correlate the output with the corresponding information displayed on the screen.</li>
<li><a href="#orientation">1.3.4 Orientation</a> — ICT with closed functionality that has fixed-in-place displays or other limitations that prevent modifying the physical display orientation should be considered as examples that are covered under the essential exception. See the note in the section <a href="#applying-sc-1-3-4-orientation-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 1.3.4 Orientation to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#identify-input-purpose">1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose</a> — Depends upon information in a programmatically determinable form; in the absence of programmatic capabilities, text labels need to be specific and be provided to the user in other modalities (e.g. auditory).</li>
<li><a href="#audio-control">1.4.2 Audio Control</a> — The intent of this success criterion is to avoid interference of audio with assistive products, which are not available in ICT with closed functionality.  If the built-in accessibility features of the ICT with closed functionality provide speech output, then the interference may happen and this success criterion applies.  In addition, there are existing requirements in regulations (e.g., the EN 301 549 and U.S. Revised 508 Standards) that address volume control for ICT with closed functionality.</li>
<li><a href="#contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a> — There are cases where applying this success criterion to non-web software on ICT with closed functionality is problematic:
<ul>
<li>When the contrast of the content is determined by the hardware and not modifiable by the software author, it may not be possible to meet this success criterion.
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-218"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-218" aria-level="3"><span>Note 1</span></div><div class="">Contrast requirements for hardware are out of scope for WCAG2ICT (and this success criterion).</div></div></li>
<li>When the color contrast ratio cannot be programmatically measured due to system limitations (e.g. lockdown), precise quantifiable testing of color contrast cannot be performed by a third party.  In such cases, the software author would need to confirm that the color combinations used meet the contrast requirement.
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-219"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-219" aria-level="3"><span>Note 2</span></div><div class="">Photographs (e.g., of a hardware display) are not sufficient for testing that content meets this success criterion.  This is because the quality of the lighting, camera, and physical aspects of the hardware display can dramatically affect the ability to capture the content for testing purposes.</div></div></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a> — Non-web software on ICT with closed functionality may offer more limited text rendering support than the support found in user agents for the Web. As a result, meeting Success Criterion 1.4.4 in a closed environment may place a much heavier burden on the content author.</li>
<li><a href="#images-of-text">1.4.5 Images of Text</a> — To enable assistive technology to modify displayed text (e.g., adjusting contrast, increasing font size), machine-readable text is needed, as opposed to mere images of text. Not all ICT with closed functionality has the capability to support visual modification of displayed text or images of text, given there is no interoperability with assistive technology and/or lack of platform support.</li>
<li><a href="#reflow">1.4.10 Reflow</a> — Some non-web software on ICT with closed functionality does not support scrolling content, or zooming, or changing the size of a viewport or scrollable content area to the specified width/height (examples include, but are not limited to, software for self-service transaction machines or kiosks).  Therefore, some other non-WCAG requirements would be needed for ICT with closed functionality to ensure that content is readable by persons with low vision without scrolling in two dimensions.

<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-220"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-220" aria-level="3"><span>Note 3</span></div><div class="">Some ICT with closed functionality does not display large chunks of text and only has UI controls.  In such cases, two-dimensional scrolling to access the text and UI controls may be considered essential, thus meeting an exception, and the success criterion would be satisfied.</div></div></li>
<li><a href="#non-text-contrast">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a> — There are cases where applying this success criterion to non-web software on ICT with closed functionality is problematic:
<ul>
<li>When the contrast of the content is determined by the hardware and not modifiable by the software author, it may not be possible to meet this success criterion.
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-221"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-221" aria-level="3"><span>Note 4</span></div><div class="">Hardware requirements for contrast are out of scope for WCAG2ICT (and this success criterion).</div></div></li>
<li>When the color contrast ratio cannot be programmatically measured due to system limitations (e.g. lockdown), precise quantifiable testing of color contrast cannot be performed by a third party. In such cases, the software author would need to confirm that the color combinations used meet the contrast requirement.

This is because the quality of the lighting, camera, and physical aspects of the hardware display can dramatically affect the ability to capture the content for testing purposes.</div></div></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#text-spacing">1.4.12 Text Spacing</a> — In non-web software on ICT with closed functionality the ability for users to modify line, paragraph, letter, or word spacing is rarely supported.  Regardless, the success criterion applies as written and as noted in the <a href="#applying-sc-1-4-12-text-spacing-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 1.4.12 Text Spacing to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#keyboard">2.1.1 Keyboard</a> — Assumes operation via a keyboard interface which also allows for alternative input devices. It may not be possible to satisfy this success criterion when the ICT does not have a built-in keyboard, and it also does not support an alternative input method (hardware or software) that provides keyboard-like access to all functionality.
<div class="note" role="note" id="issue-container-generatedID-223"><div role="heading" class="note-title marker" id="h-note-223" aria-level="3"><span>Note 6</span></div><div class="">A keypad that provides full access to functionality might be considered a keyboard.</div></div></li>
<li><a href="#no-keyboard-trap">2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap</a> — This criterion applies when focus can be moved using a keyboard interface. In some ICT with closed functionality, tactile input like numeric keypads or other functional groups of keys may be available, but there is no mechanism for onscreen focus; for example, the keys are mapped directly to functions without moving focus between on-screen controls. In this case, there is no concept of focus, and therefore keyboard traps cannot exist and this success criterion would be satisfied.</li>
<li><a href="#character-key-shortcuts">2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts</a> — ICT with closed functionality might lack a mechanism for keyboard shortcuts because their mode of operation revolves around a single key performing a single function. For such systems, this success criterion is satisfied.</li>
<li><a href="#bypass-blocks">2.4.1 Bypass Blocks</a> — The WCAG2ICT interpretation of this success criterion replaces "sets of Web pages" with "sets of software programs" which are extremely rare - especially for non-web software on ICT with closed functionality. However, being able to bypass blocks of content that are repeated within software is generally considered best practice.</li>
<li><a href="#page-titled">2.4.2 Page Titled</a> — Where the non-web software is part of a product that provides a single function, or has a menu-driven interface, the intent of this success criterion would be met without needing an explicit title.</li>
<li><a href="#link-purpose-in-context">2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)</a> — This success criterion relies upon text and context being made available in a programmatically determinable form.</li>
<li><a href="#multiple-ways">2.4.5 Multiple Ways</a> — The WCAG2ICT interpretation of this success criterion replaces "set of Web pages" with "set of software programs". Such sets, particularly in the context of non-web software on ICT with closed functionality, are exceedingly rare. There are a number of notes in the section <a href="#applying-sc-2-4-5-multiple-ways-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 2.4.5 Multiple Ways to Non-Web Documents and Software</a> that are applicable to non-web software on ICT with closed functionality.</li> 
<li><a href="#focus-visible">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a> — Presumes that there is a mode of operation where focus can be moved and controlled by keyboard. Some ICT with closed functionality may offer tactilely discernible input such as a numeric keypad or other functional groups of keys, but do not offer any mechanism for conveying focus because the user interface is designed not to need that. For example, the keys are used to select options from a spoken menu rather than to move an onscreen focus element between multiple options. In this case, there is no concept of focus, thus there is no need for a visible indicator and this success criterion would be satisfied.</li>  
<li><a href="#pointer-cancellation">2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation</a> — As noted in the section <a href="#applying-sc-2-5-2-pointer-cancellation-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>, examples of ‘essential’ functionality are features for meeting environmental energy usage requirements (like waking a device from sleep, power saver mode, and low power state).</li>  
<li><a href="#label-in-name">2.5.3 Label in Name</a> — Requires information in a programmatically determinable form; specifically, the programmatic name contains the text of the visual label.</li>
<li><a href="#target-size-minimum">2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)</a> — This success criterion uses CSS pixels for defining the target size.  ICT with closed functionality may not use CSS pixels as a standard measurement, but the definition of ‘CSS pixel’ still applies as described in <a href="#applying-css-pixel-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying “CSS pixel” to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.  If the system supports a density-independent pixel measurement, it should be used in place of CSS pixels.

<li><a href="#language-of-page">3.1.1 Language of Page</a> — Depends upon language information being in a programmatically determinable form intended to drive correct pronunciation.  Where another mechanism achieves correct pronunciation for ICT with closed functionality, such as self-voicing, the intent of this success criterion would be met.</li>
<li><a href="#language-of-parts">3.1.2 Language of Parts</a> — Depends upon language information in a programmatically determinable form intended to drive correct pronunciation.  Where another mechanism achieves correct pronunciation for ICT with closed functionality, such as self-voicing, the intent of this success criterion would be met.</li>
<li><a href="#consistent-navigation">3.2.3 Consistent Navigation</a> — This success criterion is interpreted to only apply to “sets of software programs” which are very rare.  See the second note in the section <a href="#applying-sc-3-2-3-consistent-navigation-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 3.2.3 Consistent Navigation to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>

See the second note in the section <a href="#applying-sc-3-2-4-consistent-identification-to-non-web-documents-and-software">Applying SC 3.2.4 Consistent Identification to Non-Web Documents and Software</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#consistent-help">3.2.6 Consistent Help</a> — The WCAG2ICT interpretation of this success criterion replaces "sets of Web pages" with "sets of software programs" which are extremely rare - especially for non-web software on ICT with closed functionality. However, providing consistent access to help is generally considered best practice.</li>
<li><a href="#error-identification">3.3.1 Error Identification</a> — Requires error information to be provided as text, noting that the WCAG definition of text is that it be "programmatically determinable".
</li>
<li><a href="#accessible-authentication-minimum">3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</a> — There are situations where meeting this success criterion is problematic for ICT with closed functionality:
<ul>
<li>Systems that are designed for shared use (such as in a public library) or have closed functionality might block mechanisms typically used to assist the user, such as copying authentication information from a password manager.  Instead, an alternative authentication method might be needed, such as an identity card scanner.</li>
<li>Where standards for banking or security have authentication requirements that are regulated or strictly enforced, those requirements may be judged to take legal precedence over Success Criterion 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum).</li>

Background on Text / Command-Line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces</h2><a class="self-link" href="#background-on-text-command-line-terminal-applications-and-interfaces" aria-label="Permalink for Section B. Background on Text / Command-Line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces"></a></div>

<p>The interface of a text application is realized through a server application directing which characters should be placed on the screen, along with either a hardware terminal or a terminal application that displays the characters. The client terminal application for text applications is analogous to a web user agent for web pages. Also, like web applications, text applications may execute primarily on a remote server or execute locally.</p>
<p>Some text applications render like a TeleTYpewriter (TTY); their output is always appended, like an ever-growing file. Such text applications are often called “command-line applications” or occasionally “TTY-applications”, and their output can optionally be redirected to a file for later review. Others explicitly place text into a matrix of fixed width character cells on a screen (sometimes with specific foreground and background colors).</p>
<p>Historically, input to the text application itself is provided exclusively through a keyboard interface, though Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based voice input is sometimes now an alternative option - especially on mobile devices.</p>
</section><section id="how-text-applications-have-been-made-accessible-via-assistive-technology"><div class="header-wrapper"><h3 id="b-2-how-text-applications-have-been-made-accessible-via-assistive-technology">B.2 How Text Applications Have Been Made Accessible Via Assistive Technology</h3><a class="self-link" href="#how-text-applications-have-been-made-accessible-via-assistive-technology" aria-label="Permalink for Section B.2 How Text Applications Have Been Made Accessible Via Assistive Technology"></a></div>
<p>Strategies for making text applications accessible through assistive technology involve two key tasks: (1) obtaining all of the text displayed in the interface, and (2) performing an analysis on that text to detect screen updates and attempt to discern structural elements.</p>
<p>For example, a text application screen reader might directly access the matrix of character cells in the interface and provide a screen review mechanism for the user to review that matrix of characters (by sending the output to synthetic speech and/or a braille display). Alternately, a text application screen reader might directly consume the output rendered (perhaps by acting as its own terminal application or by analyzing the “TTY” output). A text application screen reader might also attempt to analyze the spacing and layout of the text in the matrix, to provide features such as reading columns of text in a multi-column layout; discerning headers through analysis of line spacing, indentation, and capitalization; and discerning input fields or user interface components by scanning for the use of inverse video, for text appearing in brackets, or for text from the character graphics codepage (ASCII codes greater than ‘0x7F’). Some of this analysis might also be done through the use of filter tools that transform the output of a program (e.g., through reformatting “TTY” output rendered to a file or as direct input to a filter tool).</p>
<p>Similarly, a text application screen magnifier would gain access to the matrix of character cells to magnify them or re-display them in a larger font. It would scan for screen refreshes and updates and then apply heuristics to what had changed in order to decide what sub-matrix of character cells should appear in a magnified view. It would also scan for inverse video and a moving text cursor to track text being input by the user (and might combine the text matrix scanning with scanning of the keyboard input to match user input to what is appearing on the screen).</p>
</section><section id="applying-wcag-2-to-text-applications"><div class="header-wrapper"><h3 id="b-3-applying-wcag-2-to-text-applications">B.3 Applying WCAG 2 to Text Applications</h3><a class="self-link" href="#applying-wcag-2-to-text-applications" aria-label="Permalink for Section B.3 Applying WCAG 2 to Text Applications"></a></div>
<p>To apply WCAG to text applications, it is necessary to apply the glossary terms <a href="#dfn-accessibility-supported">accessibility supported</a> and <a href="#dfn-programmatically-determinable">programmatically determined</a> in the context of how text applications are rendered and the history of assistive technologies that made them accessible.</p>
<p>As noted above, in a text interface the terminal application renders the characters on the screen, just as a web browser typically renders content for a web application. As an example, for success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a>, a text application could achieve 200 percent resizing when the terminal application client that is rendering it has this capability (cf. WCAG 2 Technique <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G142">G142 Using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that support zoom</a>). Many web pages and web applications use this approach to meet success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#resize-text">1.4.4 Resize Text</a> through no explicit action of their own.</p>
<p>A similar approach could also be used for success criterion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (minimum)</a> (cf. WCAG 2 Technique <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G148">G148: Not specifying background color, not specifying text color, and not using technology features that change those defaults</a>): relying on the terminal application client to render the text with sufficient contrast against the background. In fact, many terminal applications allow the user to force all text to share a single user-chosen foreground color (and a single user-chosen background color), overriding the text application's specified colors to meet the user's desires or needs.</p>
<p>Since many assistive technology analysis techniques depend upon discerning the location of the text input cursor, terminal application use of “soft cursors” and “highlight bars” may bypass those analysis techniques and cause failures of success criteria.</p>

These examples are simply illustrations of how WCAG 2 success criteria can be applied to this class of non-web software applications.</div></div>

<p>The way to think about "accessibility supported" and "programmatically determined" may seem a little different for text applications, but the definitions are unchanged. Unlike the semantic objects of graphical user interfaces and web pages, the output of text-based applications consists of plain text. A terminal emulator acts as the user agent for text-based applications; it might render some content such as escape codes as semantic elements, but otherwise exposes only lines of text to assistive technology. Where assistive technology is able to interpret the text and any semantic objects accurately, the content is "programmatically determinable"—even though no explicit markup was necessarily used to make it so.</p>
