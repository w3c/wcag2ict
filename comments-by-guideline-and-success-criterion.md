Comments by Guideline and Success Criterion
-------------------------------------------
<div class="ednote">

The WCAG2ICT Task Force has added draft guidance for all of the Level A and AA success criteria (SC)  that are new in WCAG 2.1. There are placeholders for new WCAG 2.2 level A and AA success criteria, labeled with, "This section is to be developed by the WCAG2ICT Task Force." This guidance will be delivered in a later draft.</div>

The sections that follow are organized according to the principles, guidelines, and success criteria from WCAG 2. The text of each success criterion from WCAG 2 is copied as quoted text. Following that, the WCAG2ICT guidance is provided. Finally, the “Intent” from the WCAG 2.2 version of the Understanding for the success criterion is copied as quoted text, as these are the most current; the Task Force makes no substitutions or edits in this text. The WCAG2ICT guidance can be found in the sections where the headings begin with "Applying..." to highlight that this is the content specific to this document.

##### use-of-color

###### Applying SC 1.4.1 Use of Color to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/use-of-color#intent) (also provided below).

##### audio-control

###### Applying SC 1.4.2 Audio Control to Non-Web Documents and Software
This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-control#intent) (also provided below), replacing “on a Web page” with “in a non-web document or software”, “any content” with “any part of a non-web document or software”, “whole page” with “whole document or software”, “on the Web page” with “in the document or software”, and removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

**1.4.2 Audio Control:** If any audio <INS>**[in a [non-web document](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level. (Level A)

<div class="note">
    
Since any <INS>**[part of a [non-web document](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the <INS>**[whole document or software]**</INS>, all [content](#content-on-and-off-the-web) <INS>**[in the document or software]**</INS> (whether or not it is used to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion.</div>

##### contrast-minimum

###### Applying SC 1.4.3 Contrast Minimum to Non-Web Documents and Software

<div class="note">
    
The Intent section refers to the ability to allow users to enlarge the text on screen at least up to 200% without needing to use [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technology). This means that the application provides some means for enlarging the text 200% (zoom or otherwise) without loss of [content](#content-on-and-off-the-web) or functionality or that the application works with the platform features that meet this requirement.</div>

##### reflow

###### Applying SC 1.4.10 Reflow to Non-Web Documents and Software

<div class="ednote">Since there were open issues on WCAG asking about how 1.4.10 Reflow should be applied to non-web software, the WCAG2ICT Task Force would like feedback on whether the guidance for non-web software is sufficient, or if there are other considerations that should be covered in the notes in the WCAG2ICT guidance below. Additionally, the Task Force seeks input and examples for the following:
<ul><li>Situations where it is unclear whether the exception of a two-dimensional layout might apply.</li>
<li>Situations where 1.4.10 Reflow cannot be met.</li>
<li>Are there contexts where text sizing might be an acceptable alternative to 1.4.10 Reflow?</li>
<li>Are there situations where the content technology and/or platform software do not support reflow? If there are, please explain and indicate whether applications built for this environment should fail this criteria or have an exception so that this requirement doesn't get applied.</li>
<li>Are there situations where the content technology and/or platform software prevents users from resizing or zooming text, changing the viewport and screen orientation (all cases where reflow of content would typically be needed)? If there are, please explain and indicate whether applications built for this environment should fail this criteria or have an exception so that this requirement is not applied.</li></ul></div>

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.10](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html#intent) (also provided below), replacing “web content” with “content”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

>Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:
>
>- Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 [CSS pixels](#dfn-css-pixel);
>- Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 [CSS pixels](#dfn-css-pixel).

Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.

<div class="note">

320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For <INS>**[content]**</INS> which is designed to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom.</div>

<div class="note">
    
Examples of content which requires two-dimensional layout are images required for understanding (such as maps and diagrams), video, games, presentations, data tables (not individual cells), and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content. It is acceptable to provide two-dimensional scrolling for such parts of the content.</div>
<div class="note">

In technologies where CSS is not used, the definition of 'CSS pixel' applies as described in [Applying “CSS pixel” to Non-Web Documents and Software](#applying-css-pixel-to-non-web-documents-and-software).</div>

(non-web documents)

<div class="note">

If a [non-web document](#document) type and its available [user agents](#user-agent) do not support reflow, it may not be possible for a document of that type to meet this success criterion.</div>

(non-web software)

<div class="note">

The intent section refers to the ability for content to reflow when user agent zooming is used to scale content or when the [viewport](#dfn-viewport) changes in width. For [non-web software](#software), this means that when users scale content, adjust the size of a window or dialog, or change the screen resolution, the content will reflow without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions; or that the application works with platform features to meet this requirement.</div>
<div class="note">

Non-web software will have more frequent cases where two-dimensional layout is required for usage or meaning than what occurs on the Web. For example:
- When the software has a complex user interface with toolbars that need to be visible while manipulating content, as explained in the Intent from Understanding 1.4.10 Reflow.</div>

<div class="note">

If the content technology and platform software do not support reflow, it may not be possible for non-web software to meet this success criterion, meaning the software application would then fail this success criterion.</div>
<div class="note">

Certain platforms do not support adjusting viewports to an equivalent of 320 CSS pixels wide or 256 CSS pixels high. Likewise, some platforms have limitations on zooming as high as 400% for the larger measurements of 1280 CSS pixels wide or 1024 CSS pixels high. In such cases, implement and evaluate at the nearest possible equivalent size to what the Reflow success criterion specifies.</div>
<div class="note">

Some software applications provide a mode of operation where reflow is possible, while other modes are unable to reflow. An example is a document authoring tool, which includes both a "print preview mode" (without reflow, for users to view the spatial formatting) and a "drafting view mode" where reflow is supported.</div>

##### non-text-contrast
###### Applying SC 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as  written and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.11](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html#intent) (also provided below), replacing "user agent" with "user agent or platform software". 

With these substitutions, it would read:

>The visual [presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-presentation) of the following have a [contrast ratio](#dfn-contrast-ratio) of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):
>
>- **User Interface Components:** Visual information required to identify [user interface components](#dfn-user-interface-component) and [states](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-states), except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the <INS>**[user agent or platform software]**</INS> and not modified by the author;
>
>- **Graphical Objects:** Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential) to the information being conveyed.

<div class="note">
    
An example of appearance modification by the author is content that sets the visual style of a control, such as a color or border, to differ from the default style for the user agent or platform.</div>

<div class="note">
    
See also the [Comments on Closed Functionality](#comments-on-closed-functionality).</div>

##### text-spacing

###### Applying SC 1.4.12 Text Spacing to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as  written and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.12](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/text-spacing.html#intent) (also provided below) replacing "In content implemented using markup languages" with "For non-web documents or software content implemented using markup languages" and replacing "that support " with "in a way that supports modification of". 

**With these substitutions, it would read:** 

><INS>**[For non-web documents or software]**</INS> content implemented using markup languages <INS>**[in a way that supports modification of]**</INS> the following [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-text) [style properties](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-style-properties), no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:
> * Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;
> * Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;
> * Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;
> * Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.
>
> Exception: Human languages and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script.

<div class="note">

"Content implemented using markup languages" includes parts of software that use markup internally to define a user interface. Examples of markup languages that are used internally to define a software user interface include but are not limited to: HTML (e.g., in [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) applications or iOS application Web views), XAML, XML (e.g., in Android application layouts), and XUL.</div>

<div class="note">
    
There are several mechanisms that allow users to modify text spacing properties of content implemented in markup languages. For example, an eBook technology may have an available user agent that allows users to override document text styles, or a software application may provide a "user style sheet" facility to modify the appearance of the software's own user interface. This Success Criterion does not require that documents and software implement their own mechanisms to allow users to set text spacing; however, when such a mechanism is available, the Success Criterion requires that content respond appropriately to it.</div>

##### content-on-hover-or-focus

###### Applying SC 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.13](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html) (also provided below), replacing "user agent" with "user agent or platform software",  "browser tooltips" with "tooltips", and "the HTML title attribute" with "user interface object attributes".

With these substitutions, it would read:

> Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:
> 
> **Dismissible**
>    A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an [input error](#dfn-input-error) or does not obscure or replace other content;
> 
> **Hoverable**
>    If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;
> 
> **Persistent**
>    The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.
> 
> Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the <INS>**[[user agent](#user-agent) or platform [software](#software)]**</INS> and is not modified by the author.
> 
><div class="note">
>
>Examples of additional content controlled by the <INS>**[user agent or platform software]**</INS> include <INS>**[tooltips]**</INS> created through use of <INS>**[user interface object attributes]**</INS>.</div>
> 
> <div class="note">Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups that display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.</div>
><div class="note"> NOTE
>
>This criterion applies to content that appears in addition to the triggering component itself. Since hidden components that are made visible on keyboard focus (such as links used to skip to another part of a page) do not present additional content they are not covered by this criterion.</div>

### operable

#### Applying Principle 2 Operable to Non-Web Documents and Software

In WCAG 2, the Principles are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not required for conformance to WCAG. Principle 2 applies directly as written.

#### keyboard-accessible

##### Applying Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible to Non-Web Documents and Software

In WCAG 2, the Guidelines are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not required for conformance to WCAG. Guideline 2.1 applies directly as written.

##### keyboard

###### Applying SC 2.1.1 Keyboard to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard#intent) (also provided below).

<div class="note">
    
This does not imply that software always needs to directly support a keyboard or “keyboard interface”. Nor does it imply that software always needs to provide a soft keyboard. Underlying platform software may provide device independent input services to applications that enable operation via a keyboard. Software that supports operation via such platform device independent services would be operable by a keyboard and would comply.</div>
<div class="note">
    
See also the [Comments on Closed Functionality](#comments-on-closed-functionality).</div>

##### no-keyboard-trap

###### Applying SC 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.1.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap#intent) (also provided below), replacing “page” and “Web page” with “non-web document or software” and removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

**2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap:** If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the <INS>**[[non-web document](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> using a [keyboard interface](#dfn-keyboard-interface), then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away. (Level A)

<div class="note">
    
Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole <INS>**[[non-web document](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS>, all content on the <INS>**[non-web document or software]**</INS> (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion.</div>
<div class="note">

Standard exit methods may vary by platform. For example, on many desktop platforms, the Escape key is a standard method for exiting.</div>

##### character-key-shortcuts

###### Applying SC 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.1.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/character-key-shortcuts.html) (also provided below).

<div class="note">
    
The WCAG2ICT interpretation is that a long press of a key (2 seconds or more) and other accessibility features provided by the platform do not meet the WCAG definition of a keyboard shortcut. See the [keyboard shortcut](#dfn-keyboard-shortcut) definition for more details.</div>

#### enough-time

##### Applying Guideline 2.2 Enough Time to Non-Web Documents and Software

In WCAG 2, the Guidelines are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not required for conformance to WCAG. Guideline 2.2 applies directly as written.

##### timing-adjustable

###### Applying SC 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/timing-adjustable#intent) (also provided below), replacing “the content” with “non-web documents or software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

**2.2.1 Timing Adjustable:** For each time limit that is set by <INS>**[[non-web documents](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS>, at least one of the following is true: (Level A)

*   **Turn off:** The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
*   **Adjust:** The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
*   **Extend:** The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, “press the space bar”), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
*   **Real-time Exception:** The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
*   **Essential Exception:** The time limit is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential) and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
*   **20 Hour Exception:** The time limit is longer than 20 hours.
    
<div class="note">
    
This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with [Success Criterion 3.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#on-focus), which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.</div>

##### pause-stop-hide

###### Applying SC 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide#intent) (also provided below), replacing “page” and “Web page” with “non-web documents and software” and removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference” in Note 2 of the success criterion.

With this substitution, it would read:

**2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide:** For moving, [blinking](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-blinking), scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true: (Level A)

*   **Moving, blinking, scrolling:** For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to [pause](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-pause), stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential); and
    
*   **Auto-updating:** For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.

Since any [content](#content-on-and-off-the-web) that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole <INS>**[[non-web documents](#document) and [software](#software)]**</INS>, all content on the <INS>**[non-web documents and software]**</INS> (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion.</div>
<div class="note">
    
[Content](#content-on-and-off-the-web) that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.</div>

##### three-flashes-or-below-threshold

##### Applying SC 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold#intent) (also provided below), replacing “Web pages” with “non-web documents or software” , “the whole page” with “the whole non-web document or software”, “the Web page” with “the non-web document or software”, and removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

**2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold:** <INS>**[[Non-web documents](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the [flash](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-flashes) is below the [general flash and red flash thresholds](#dfn-general-flash-and-red-flash-thresholds). (Level A)

<div class="note">

In WCAG 2, the Guidelines are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not required for conformance to WCAG. Guideline 2.4 applies directly as written.

##### bypass-blocks

###### Applying SC 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written and described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/bypass-blocks#intent) (also provided below), replacing “Web pages” with “non-web documents in a set of non-web documents” or “software programs in a set of software programs” to explicitly state that the multiple documents (or software programs) are part of a set rather than any two documents or pieces of software.

With these substitutions, this success criterion would read:

(for non-web documents)

**2.4.1 Bypass Blocks:** A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple <INS>**[[non-web documents](#document) in a [set of non-web documents](#set-of-documents)]**</INS>.

(for software programs)

**2.4.1 Bypass Blocks:** A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple <INS>**[[software programs](#software) in a [set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs)]**</INS>.

<div class="note">
    
See [set of documents](#set-of-documents) and [set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs) in the Key Terms section of the Introduction to determine when a group of documents or pieces of software is considered a set for this success criterion. (Sets of software that meet this definition appear to be extremely rare.)</div>
<div class="note">
    
Individual documents or software programs (not in a set) would automatically meet this success criterion because this success criterion applies only to things that appear in a set.</div>
<div class="note">
    
Although not required by the success criterion, being able to bypass blocks of content that are repeated _within_ non-web documents or software directly addresses user needs identified in the Intent section for this Success Criterion, and is generally considered best practice.</div>
<div class="note">
    
Many software user interface components have built-in mechanisms to navigate directly to / among them, which also have the effect of skipping over or bypassing blocks of content.</div>

##### page-titled

###### Applying SC 2.4.2 Page Titled to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/page-titled#intent) (also provided below) replacing “Web pages” with “non-web documents or software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

**2.4.2 Page Titled:** <INS>**[[Non-web documents](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> have titles that describe topic or purpose. (Level A)

<div class="note">
    
As described in the WCAG intent (also provided below), the name of a [non-web software application](#software) or [non-web document](#document) (e.g. document, media file, etc.) is a sufficient title if it describes the topic or purpose.</div>
<div class="note">
    
See also the [Comments on Closed Functionality](#comments-on-closed-functionality).</div>

##### focus-order

###### Applying SC 2.4.3 Focus Order to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-order#intent) (also provided below) replacing “a Web page” with “non-web documents or software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

**2.4.3 Focus Order:** If <INS>**[[non-web documents](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability. (Level A)

##### link-purpose-in-context

###### Applying SC 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/link-purpose-in-context#intent) (also provided below).

<div class="note">
    
In software, a “link” is any text string or image in the user interface outside a user interface control that behaves like a hypertext link. This does not include general user interface controls or buttons. (An OK button, for example, would not be a link.)</div>

##### multiple-ways

###### Applying SC 2.4.5 Multiple Ways to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written and described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/multiple-ways#intent) (also provided below), replacing “set of Web pages” with “set of non-web documents” and “set of software programs”.

With these substitutions, this success criterion would read:

(for non-web documents)

**2.4.5 Multiple Ways:** More than one way is available to locate a <INS>**[[non-web document](#document)]**</INS> within a <INS>**[[set of non-web documents](#set-of-documents)]**</INS> except where the <INS>**[non-web document]**</INS> is the result of, or a step in, a [process](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-processes).

(for software programs)

**2.4.5 Multiple Ways:** More than one way is available to locate a <INS>**[[software program](#software)]**</INS> within a <INS>**[[set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs)]**</INS> except where the <INS>**[software program]**</INS> is the result of, or a step in, a [process](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-processes).

<div class="note">
    
See [set of documents](#set-of-documents) and [set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs) in the Key Terms section of the Introduction to determine when a group of documents or software is considered a set for this success criterion. (Sets of software that meet this definition appear to be extremely rare.)</div><div class="note">

The definitions of “[set of documents](#set-of-documents)” and “[set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs)” in the Key Terms section of the Introduction are predicated on the ability to navigate from each element of the set to each other, and navigation is a type of locating. So the mechanism used to navigate between elements of the set will be one way of locating information in the set. Non-web environments, generally major operating systems with browse and search capabilities, often provide infrastructure and tools that provide mechanisms for locating content in a set of non-web documents or a set of software programs. For example, it may be possible to browse through the files or programs that make up a set, or search within members of the set for the names of other members. A file directory would be the equivalent of a site map for documents in a set, and a search function in a file system would be equivalent to a web search function for web pages. Such facilities may provide additional ways of locating information in the set.</div>
<div class="note">
    
An example of the use of “a software program that is part of process”, that would meet the exception for this Success Criterion, would be one where programs are interlinked but the interlinking depends on program A being used before program B, for validation or to initialize the dataset etc.</div>
<div class="note">
    
While some users may find it useful to have multiple ways to locate some groups of user interface elements within a document or software program, this is not required by the success criterion (and may pose difficulties in some situations).</div>
<div class="note">
    
The definitions of “[set of documents](#set-of-documents)” and “[set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs)” in WCAG2ICT require every item in the set to be independently reachable, and so nothing in such a set can be a “step in a process” that can't be reached any other way. The purpose of the exception—that items in a process are exempt from meeting this success criterion—is achieved by the definition of set.</div>

##### headings-and-labels

###### Applying SC 2.4.6 Headings and Labels to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/headings-and-labels#intent) (also provided below).

<div class="note">
    
In [software](#software), headings and labels are used to describe sections of [content](#content-on-and-off-the-web) and controls respectively. In some cases it may be unclear whether a piece of static text is a heading or a label. But whether treated as a label or a heading, the requirement is the same: that if they are present they describe the topic or purpose of the item(s) they are associated with.</div>

##### focus-visible

###### Applying SC 2.4.7 Focus Visible to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.7](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible#intent) (also provided below).

In WCAG 2, the Guidelines are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not required for conformance to WCAG. Guideline 2.5 applies directly as written.

##### pointer-gestures

###### Applying SC 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures to Non-Web Documents and Software
<div class="ednote">The WCAG2ICT Task Force seeks input on whether there are other examples of non-web documents that support the ability for authors to add gesture actions to the document that are not interpreted and acted upon through a user agent. If such example exist, we need broaden our example beyond prototyping software.</div>

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pointer-gestures#intent) (also provided below), making changes to the notes for non-web documents by replacing “web content” with "content", for non-web software applications by replacing "web content that interprets" with "user agents and other software applications that interpret" and "user agent" with "underlying platform software", and for non-web platform software replacing "web content" with "platform software".

With these substitutions, the notes would read:

(non-web documents)

<div class="note">

This requirement applies to <INS>**[content]**</INS> that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).</div>

<div class="note">

Multipoint and path-based gestures are less common in documents. An example where a document author could add such gestures is an interactive prototype document created in a software design tool.</div>

<div class="note">

This requirement also applies to **<INS>[[platform software](#software)]</INS>** that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the assistive technology).</div>

##### pointer-cancellation

###### Applying SC 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html#intent) (also provided below), making changes to the notes for non-web documents by replacing “web content” with "content", for non-web software applications by replacing "web content that interprets" with "user agents and other software applications that interpret" and "user agent" with "underlying platform software", and for non-web platform software replacing "web content" with "platform software".

With these substitutions, the notes would read: 

(for non-web documents)
<div class="note">
    
Functions that emulate a keyboard or numeric keypad key press are considered essential.</div>

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/motion-actuation.html#intent) (also provided below).

##### dragging-movements

###### Applying SC 2.5.7 Dragging Movements to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.7](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements.html#intent) (also provided below), replacing "user agent" with "user agent or platform software", and making changes to the notes for non-web documents by replacing “web content” with "content", for non-web software applications by replacing "web content that interprets" with "user agents and other software applications that interpret" and "user agent" with "underlying platform software", and for non-web platform software replacing "web content" with "platform software".

With these substitutions, it would read:

All functionality that uses a dragging movement for operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is essential or the functionality is determined by the **<INS>[[user agent](#user-agent) or platform software]</INS>** and not modified by the author.

(non-web documents)
<div class="note">

This requirement applies to [content](#content-on-and-off-the-web) that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).</div>

<div class="note">

Dragging movements for operation are less common in documents. An example where a document author could add dragging functionality is an interactive prototype document created in a software design tool.</div>

(non-web software)
<div class="note">

This requirement applies to **<INS>[user agents and other [software](#software) applications that interpret]</INS>** pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the **<INS>[underlying platform software]</INS>** or assistive technology).</div>

<div class="note">

This requirement also applies to **<INS>[[platform software](#software)]</INS>** that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the assistive technology).</div>

##### target-size-minimum

###### Applying SC 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) to Non-Web Documents and Software:

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.5.8](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html#intent), replacing "user agent" with "user agent or platform software", and "on the same page" with "in the same non-web document or software".

With these substitutions, it would read:

The size of the [target](#dfn-target) for [pointer inputs](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-pointer-inputs) is at least 24 by 24 [CSS pixels](#dfn-css-pixel), except where:

- **Spacing:** Undersized targets (those less than 24 by 24 CSS pixels) are positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the [bounding box](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-bounding-boxes) of each, the circles do not intersect another target or the circle for another undersized target;
- **Equivalent:** The function can be achieved through a different control **<INS>[in the same [non-web document](#document) or [software](#software)]</INS>** that meets this criterion.
- **Inline:** The target is in a sentence or its size is otherwise constrained by the line-height of non-target text;
- **<INS>[User agent or platform software]</INS> control:** The size of the target and target offset is determined by the **<INS>[[user agent](#user-agent) or platform software]</INS>** and is not modified by the author;
- **Essential:** A particular [presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-presentation) of the target is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential) or is legally required for the information being conveyed;

<div class="note">

Targets that allow for values to be selected spatially based on position within the target are considered one target for the purpose of the success criterion. Examples include sliders with granular values, color pickers displaying a gradient of colors, or editable areas where you position the cursor.</div>
<div class="note">

For inline targets the line-height should be interpreted as perpendicular to the flow of text. For example, in a language displayed vertically, the line-height would be horizontal.</div>
<div class="note">

In technologies where CSS is not used, the definition of 'CSS pixel' applies as described in [Applying “CSS pixel” to Non-Web Documents and Software](#applying-css-pixel-to-non-web-documents-and-software).</div>

(for non-web documents)

<div class="note">

Some document formats are designed for viewing at a wide range of zoom levels provided by the user agent. However, the commonly available user agents for these formats may lack a consistent base zoom level from which to evaluate this criterion. For such documents, evaluate target sizes at a zoom level that aligns with the intended usage of the content.</div>

<div class="note">
    
Where software platforms provide a “locale / language” setting, applications that use that setting and render their interface in that “locale / language” would comply with this success criterion. Applications that do not use the platform “locale / language” setting but instead use an [accessibility-supported](#dfn-accessibility-supported) method for exposing the human language of the [software](#software) would also comply with this success criterion.

<div class="note">
    
Some compound documents and their user agents are designed to provide significantly different viewing and editing functionality depending upon what portion of the compound document is being interacted with (e.g. a presentation that contains an embedded spreadsheet, where the menus and toolbars of the user agent change depending upon whether the user is interacting with the presentation content, or the embedded spreadsheet content). If the user uses a mechanism other than putting focus on that portion of the compound document with which they mean to interact (e.g. by a menu choice or special keyboard gesture), any resulting [change of context](#dfn-changes-of-context) wouldn't be subject to this success criterion because it was not caused by a change of focus.</div>

**3.2.4 Consistent Identification:** Components that have the [same functionality](#dfn-same-functionality) within a <INS>**[[set of non-web documents](#set-of-documents)]**</INS> are identified consistently.

(for programs)

**3.2.4 Consistent Identification:** Components that have the [same functionality](#dfn-same-functionality) within a <INS>**[[set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs)]**</INS> are identified consistently.

<div class="note">
    
See [set of documents](#set-of-documents) and [set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs) in the Key Terms section of the Introduction to determine when a group of documents or software programs is considered a set for this success criterion. (Sets of software that meet this definition appear to be extremely rare.)</div>
<div class="note">
    
Although not required by this success criterion, ensuring that component identification be consistent when they occur more than once _within_ non-web documents or software programs directly addresses user needs identified in the Intent section for this Success Criterion, and is generally considered best practice.</div>

##### consistent-help

###### Applying SC 3.2.6 Consistent Help to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.2.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help#intent) (also provided below), replacing "Web page(s)" and "page(s)" with "non-web document(s) or software program(s)", "set of Web pages" with "set of non-web documents or set of software programs", "page content" with "content", "on the page" with "in the non-web document or software", "page is serialized" with "non-web document or software content is serialized", "different page" with "different non-web document, software, or Web page", and "page variation" with "content layout variation".

With these substitutions, this success criterion would read:

If a **<INS>[[non-web document](#document) or [software](#software)]</INS>** contains any of the following help [mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism), and those mechanisms are repeated **<INS>[in multiple non-web documents or software]</INS>** within a **<INS>[[set of non-web documents](#set-of-documents) or [set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs)]</INS>**, they occur in the same order relative to other **<INS>[[content](#content-on-and-off-the-web)]</INS>**, unless a change is initiated by the user:

* Human contact details;
* Human contact mechanism;
* Self-help option;
* A fully automated contact mechanism

<div class="note">

Help mechanisms may be provided directly **<INS>[in the non-web document or software]</INS>**, or may be provided via a direct link to a **<INS>[different non-web document, software, or Web page]</INS>** containing the information.</div>
<div class="note">
    
For this Success Criterion, "the same order relative to other **<INS>[content]</INS>**" can be thought of as how the content is ordered when the **<INS>[non-web document or software content is serialized]</INS>**. The visual position of a help mechanism is likely to be consistent across **<INS>[non-web documents or software]</INS>** for the same **<INS>[content layout variation]</INS>** (e.g., CSS break-point). The user can initiate a change, such as changing the **<INS>[non-web document’s or software's]</INS>** zoom or orientation, which may trigger a different **<INS>[content layout variation]</INS>**. This criterion is concerned with relative order across **<INS>[non-web documents or software]</INS>** displayed in the same **<INS>[content layout variation]</INS>** (e.g., same zoom level and orientation).</div>
<div class="note">
    
See [set of documents](#set-of-documents) and [set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs) in the Key Terms section of the Introduction to determine when a group of documents or pieces of software is considered a set for this success criterion. (Sets of software that meet this definition appear to be extremely rare.)</div>

#### input-assistance

##### Applying Guideline 3.3 Input Assistance to Non-Web Documents and Software

In WCAG 2, the Guidelines are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not required for conformance to WCAG. Guideline 3.3 applies directly as written.

##### error-identification

###### Applying SC 3.3.1 Error Identification to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-identification#intent) (also provided below).

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/labels-or-instructions#intent) (also provided below).

##### error-suggestion

###### Applying SC 3.3.3 Error Suggestion to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-suggestion#intent) (also provided below).

##### error-prevention-legal-financial-data

###### Applying SC 3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data) to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/error-prevention-legal-financial-data#intent) (also provided below) replacing “web pages” with “non-web documents or software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

**3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data):** For <INS>**[[non-web documents](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> that cause [legal commitments](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-legal-commitments) or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete [user-controllable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-controllable) data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true: (Level AA)

1.  **Reversible:** Submissions are reversible.
    
2.  **Checked:** Data entered by the user is checked for [input errors](#dfn-input-error) and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them.
    
3.  **Confirmed:** A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before finalizing the submission.

##### redundant-entry

###### Applying SC 3.3.7 Redundant Entry to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.7](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/redundant-entry#intent) (also provided below).

##### accessible-authentication-minimum

###### Applying SC 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum) to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.8](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication-minimum.html) (also provided below), “the Web site” with “a Web site, non-web document, or software”.

A [cognitive function test](#dfn-cognitive-function-test) (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication [process](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-processes) unless that step provides at least one of the following:

<dl>
<dt>Alternative</dt>
<dd>Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.</dd>
<dt>Mechanism</dt>
<dd>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism">mechanism</a> is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.</dd>
<dt>Object Recognition</dt>
<dd>The cognitive function test is to recognize objects.</dd>
<dt>Personal Content</dt>
<dd>
    
The cognitive function test is to identify <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-non-text-content">non-text content</a> the user provided to <INS>**[a Web site, [non-web document](#document), or [software](#software)]**</INS>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="note">

"Object recognition" and "Personal content" may be represented by images, video, or audio.</div>
<div class="note">

Examples of mechanisms that satisfy this criterion include: support for password entry by password managers to reduce memory need, and copy and paste to reduce the cognitive burden of re-typing.</div>
<div class="note">
    
If the non-web software is an application, passwords used to unlock the underlying platform software are out of scope for this requirement as these are not up to a software application’s author.</div>

### robust

#### Applying Principle 4 Robust to Non-Web Documents and Software

In WCAG 2, the Principles are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not required for conformance to WCAG. Principle 4 applies directly as written replacing “user agents, including assistive technologies” with “assistive technologies and accessibility features of software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

Principle 4: Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of <INS>**[[assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technology) and accessibility features of software]**</INS>.

#### compatible

##### Applying Guideline 4.1 Compatible to Non-Web Documents and Software

In WCAG 2, the Guidelines are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not required for conformance to WCAG. Guideline 4.1 applies directly as written, replacing “user agents, including assistive technologies” with “assistive technologies and accessibility features of software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

Guideline 4.1 Compatible: Maximize compatibility with current and future <INS>**[[assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technology) and accessibility features of software]**</INS>.

##### parsing

###### Applying SC 4.1.1 Parsing to Non-Web Documents and Software

**WCAG 2.2 Guidance:**
<div class="note">

WCAG 2.2 has made this success criterion obsolete and removed it as a requirement in the standard. Therefore, the interpretation of this success criterion for [non-web documents](#document) and [software](#software) has been removed.</div>

**WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 Guidance:**

WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 are incorporated, either directly or by reference, into other standards. Therefore, the application of 4.1.1 Parsing to non-web documents and software is to follow the new guidance provided in the [WCAG 2.0 Editorial Errata](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/errata/#editorial) and the [WCAG 2.1 Editorial Errata](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/errata/#editorial) which states the following:

>This Success Criterion should be considered as always satisfied for any content using HTML or XML.

<div class="note">
    
As in Web content, 4.1.1 Parsing is not known to have any effect on the accessibility of non-web documents or software. There are no known examples of non-web documents or software that would have an issue such as those covered by 4.1.1 Parsing. Modern assistive technology does not parse document or software markdown languages for accessibility information. User agents and platforms used to render non-web documents and software use platform accessibility APIs to present accessibility information to AT. Therefore, 4.1.1 Parsing would no longer be a requirement for accessibility.</div>

<div class="note">

Where an existing standard requires 4.1.1 parsing for non-web documents and software, this Success Criterion would be automatically satisfied.</div>

##### name-role-value

###### Applying SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value#intent) (also provided below), replacing the note with: “This success criterion is primarily for software developers who develop or use custom user interface components. For example, standard user interface components on most accessibility-supported platforms already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.”.

With this substitution, it would read:

**4.1.2 Name, Role, Value:** For all [user interface components](#dfn-user-interface-component) (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the [name](#dfn-name) and [role](#dfn-role) can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determined); states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be [programmatically set](#dfn-programmatically-set); and notification of changes to these items is available to [user agents](#user-agent), including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technology). (Level A)

<div class="note">
    
<INS>**[This success criterion is primarily for software developers who develop or use custom user interface components. Standard user interface components on most [accessibility-supported](#dfn-accessibility-supported) platforms already meet this success criterion when used according to specification.]**</INS></div>
<div class="note">
    
For conforming to this success criterion, it is usually best practice for software user interfaces to use the accessibility services provided by platform software. These accessibility services enable interoperability between software user interfaces and both assistive technologies and accessibility features of software in standardized ways. Most platform accessibility services go beyond programmatic exposure of name and role, and programmatic setting of states, properties and values (and notification of same), and specify additional information that could be exposed and / or set (for instance, a list of the available actions for a given user interface component, and a means to programmatically execute one of the listed actions).</div>
<div class="note">

For document formats that support interoperability with assistive technology, standard user interface components often meet this success criterion when used according to the general design and accessibility guidance for the document format.</div>
<div class="note">

##### status-messages

###### Applying SC 4.1.3 Status Messages to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/status-messages.html#intent) (also provided below) replacing "In content implemented using markup languages" with "In content implemented using markup languages, or that supports status message notifications".

With this substitution, it would read:
In <INS>**[content implemented using markup languages, or that supports status message notifications]**</INS>, [status messages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-status-messages) can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determined) through [role](#dfn-role) or properties such that they can be presented to the user by [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technology) without receiving focus.

<div class="note">
    
For [non-web documents](#document) and [software](#software) that are not implemented using markup languages, there is still a user need to have status messages be programmatically exposed so that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus. This is typically enabled through the use of accessibility services of the user agent or platform software.</div>
