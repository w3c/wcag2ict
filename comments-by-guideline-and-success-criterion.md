##### audio-control

###### Applying SC 1.4.2 Audio Control to Non-Web Documents and Software
This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-control#intent), replacing “on a web page” with “in the non-web document or software”, “whole page” with “whole non-web document or software”, and “on the web page” with “in the non-web document or software”; removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”; and adjusting Note 1 to avoid the use of the normative term "must".

With these substitutions, it would read:

**1.4.2 Audio Control:** If any audio <INS>**[in the [non-web document](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.

<div class="note wcag2ict"> 

The Intent section refers to the ability to allow users to enlarge the text on screen at least up to 200% without needing to use [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies). This means that the application provides some means for enlarging the text 200% (zoom or otherwise) without loss of [content](#content-on-and-off-the-web) or functionality, or that the application works with the platform accessibility features to satisfy this success criterion.</div>

<div class="note wcag2ict">
	
For non-web software, there may be cases where the platform does not scale all text up to 200%. In such cases, authors are encouraged to meet user needs by scaling text to the extent supported by user settings in the platform.</div>

<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
See also the [Comments on Closed Functionality](#comments-on-closed-functionality).</div>

##### reflow

###### Applying SC 1.4.10 Reflow to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.10](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reflow.html#intent), replacing “web content” with “content”.

With this substitution, it would read:

**1.4.10 Reflow:** Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:

- Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 [CSS pixels](#dfn-css-pixels);
- Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 [CSS pixels](#dfn-css-pixels).

Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.

<div class="note">

320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For <INS>**[content]**</INS> which is designed to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom.</div>

<div class="note">

Examples of content which requires two-dimensional layout are images required for understanding (such as maps and diagrams), video, games, presentations, data tables (not individual cells), and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content. It is acceptable to provide two-dimensional scrolling for such parts of the content.</div>

<div class="note wcag2ict">

In technologies where CSS is not used, the definition of 'CSS pixel' applies as described in [Applying “CSS pixel” to Non-Web Documents and Software](#applying-css-pixel-to-non-web-documents-and-software).</div>

(for non-web documents)

<div class="note wcag2ict">

If a [non-web document](#document) type and its available [user agents](#user-agent) do not support reflow, it may not be possible for a document of that type to satisfy this success criterion.</div>

(for non-web software)

<div class="note wcag2ict">

The intent section refers to the ability for content to reflow (for vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels, or for horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels) when user agent zooming is used to scale content or when the [viewport](#dfn-viewport) changes in width. For [non-web software](#software), this means that when users scale content, adjust the size of a window, dialog, or other resizable content area, or change the screen resolution, the content will reflow without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions; or that the application works with platform features that satisfy this success criterion.</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">

Non-web software will have more frequent cases where two-dimensional layout is relied upon for usage or meaning than what occurs on the Web. For example:
- When the software has a complex user interface with toolbars that need to be visible while manipulating content, as explained in the Intent from Understanding 1.4.10 Reflow.</div>

<div class="note wcag2ict">

As written, this success criterion can only be met by non-web documents or software where the underlying user agent or platform can present content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels for vertical scrolling content and a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels for horizontal scrolling content.

When the underlying user agent or platform does not support these dimensions for scrolling, reflow is encouraged as this capability is important to people with low vision. As a reasonable benchmark, evaluate at the nearest size to what the Reflow success criterion specifies.

When users modify zoom, scaling, and/or display resolution at the platform software level (e.g. Operating System), it impacts the size of all applications and the [platform software](#platform-software) itself. This can result in improved readability in some applications but unwanted consequences in others.</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">

Some software applications provide a mode of operation where reflow is possible, while other modes are unable to reflow. An example is a document authoring tool, which includes both a "print preview mode" (without reflow, for users to view the spatial formatting) and a "drafting view mode" where reflow is supported. Such software would satisfy this success criterion as long as there is no loss of information or functionality in the drafting view.</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">

##### non-text-contrast

###### Applying SC 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.11](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html#intent), replacing "user agent" with "user agent or platform software".

With this substitution, it would read:

**1.4.11 Non-text Contrast:** The visual [presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-presentation) of the following have a [contrast ratio](#dfn-contrast-ratio) of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):

<dl><dt>User Interface Components</dt>
<dd>Visual information required to identify <a href="#dfn-user-interface-components">user interface components</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-states">states</a>, except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the <INS><strong>[<a href="#user-agent">user agent</a> or <a href="#platform-software">platform software</a>]</strong></INS> and not modified by the author;</dd>

<dt>Graphical Objects</dt>
<dd>Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential">essential</a> to the information being conveyed.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
An example of appearance modification by the author is content that sets the visual style of a control, such as a color or border, to differ from the default style for the user agent or platform.</div>

<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
See also the [Comments on Closed Functionality](#comments-on-closed-functionality).</div>

##### text-spacing

###### Applying SC 1.4.12 Text Spacing to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as  written and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.12](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/text-spacing.html#intent). 

<div class="note wcag2ict">

This success criterion only applies to [non-web documents](#document) and [software](#software) that are implemented using markup languages and allow the user to modify these text spacing properties.</div>

<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
There are several mechanisms that allow users to modify text spacing properties of content implemented in markup languages. For example, an eBook technology may have an available user agent that allows users to override document text styles, or a software application may provide a "user style sheet" facility to modify the appearance of the software's own user interface. This success criterion does not mean that non-web software needs to implement their own mechanisms to allow users to set text spacing; however, when such a mechanism is available, the success criterion requires that content respond appropriately to it.</div>

(for non-web software)
<div class="note wcag2ict">

"Content implemented using markup languages" includes parts of software that use markup internally to define a user interface. Examples of markup languages that are used internally to define a software user interface include but are not limited to: HTML (e.g., in [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) applications or iOS application web views), XAML, XML (e.g., in Android application layouts), and XUL.</div>

<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
See also the [Comments on Closed Functionality](#comments-on-closed-functionality).</div>

##### content-on-hover-or-focus

###### Applying SC 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.13](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html), replacing "user agent" with "user agent or platform software", "browser tooltips" with "tooltips", and "the HTML title attribute" with "user interface object attributes".

With these substitutions, it would read:

**1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus:** Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:

<DL><DT>Dismissible</DT>
<DD>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism">mechanism</a> is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an <a href="#dfn-input-error">input error</a> or does not obscure or replace other content;</DD>

<DT>Hoverable</DT>
<DD>If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;</DD>

<DT>Persistent</DT>
<DD>The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.</DD></DL>

Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the <INS>**[[user agent](#user-agent) or [platform software](#platform-software)]**</INS> and is not modified by the author.

<div class="note">

Examples of additional content controlled by the <INS>**[user agent or platform software]**</INS> include <INS>**[tooltips]**</INS> created through use of <INS>**[user interface object attributes]**</INS>.</div>
 
<div class="note">Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups that display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.</div>
<div class="note">

This criterion applies to content that appears in addition to the triggering component itself. Since hidden components that are made visible on keyboard focus (such as links used to skip to another part of a page) do not present additional content they are not covered by this criterion.</div>

### operable

#### Applying Principle 2 Operable to Non-Web Documents and Software

In WCAG 2, the Principles are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not used for conformance to WCAG. Principle 2 applies directly as written.

#### keyboard-accessible

##### Applying Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible to Non-Web Documents and Software

In WCAG 2, the Guidelines are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not used for conformance to WCAG. Guideline 2.1 applies directly as written.

##### keyboard

###### Applying SC 2.1.1 Keyboard to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard#intent).

(for non-web software)
<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
Keyboard interface does not refer to a physical device but to the interface between the software and any keyboard or keyboard substitute (i.e., the interface where the software accepts text or other keystroke input from the platform which may come from a keyboard or from a keyboard alternative). [Platform software](#platform-software) may provide a ‘keyboard interface’ that software can read instead of reading any keyboard hardware directly. When software supports such a device-independent service of the platform, and the software or non-web document functionality is made fully operable through the service, then this success criterion would be satisfied.</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">

This success criterion does not imply that software always needs to directly support a keyboard or “keyboard interface”. Nor does it imply that software always needs to provide a [virtual keyboard](#virtual-keyboard).</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
See also the [Comments on Closed Functionality](#comments-on-closed-functionality).</div>

##### no-keyboard-trap

###### Applying SC 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.1.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap#intent), replacing “page” with “non-web document or software” and “on the web page” with "in the non-web document or software"; removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”; and adjusting Note 1 to avoid the use of the normative term "must".

With these substitutions, it would read:

**2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap:** If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the <INS>**[[non-web document](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> using a [keyboard interface](#dfn-keyboard-interface), then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.

<div class="note">
    
Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole <INS>**[[non-web document](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS>, <INS>**[it would be necessary for]**</INS> all content <INS>**[in the non-web document or software]**</INS> (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) <INS>**[to]**</INS> meet this success criterion.</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">

Standard exit methods may vary by platform. For example, on many desktop platforms, the Escape key is a standard method for exiting.</div>

(for non-web software)
<div class="note wcag2ict">

This criterion applies when focus can be moved using a keyboard interface. Some software may accept input from a keyboard, keypad, or controller, yet not offer any mechanism for focus; for example, the keys are mapped directly to functions without moving focus between on-screen controls. In this case, there is no concept of focus, and therefore keyboard traps cannot exist and this success criterion would be satisfied.</div>

##### character-key-shortcuts

###### Applying SC 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.1.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/character-key-shortcuts.html).

(for non-web software)
<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
The WCAG2ICT interpretation is that a long press of a key (2 seconds or more) and other accessibility features provided by the platform do not meet the WCAG definition of a keyboard shortcut. See the [keyboard shortcut](#dfn-keyboard-shortcuts) definition for more details.</div>

#### enough-time

##### Applying Guideline 2.2 Enough Time to Non-Web Documents and Software

In WCAG 2, the Guidelines are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not used for conformance to WCAG. Guideline 2.2 applies directly as written.

##### timing-adjustable

###### Applying SC 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/timing-adjustable#intent), replacing “ content” with “non-web document or software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

**2.2.1 Timing Adjustable:** For each time limit that is set by the <INS>**[[non-web document](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS>, at least one of the following is true:

<dl><dt>Turn off</dt>
<dd>The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or</dd>
	
<dt>Adjust</dt>
<dd>The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or</dd>

<dt>Extend</dt>
<dd>The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, “press the space bar”), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or</dd>

<dt>Real-time Exception</dt>
<dd>The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or</dd>

<dt>Essential Exception</dt>
<dd>The time limit is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential">essential</a> and extending it would invalidate the activity; or</dd>

<dt>20 Hour Exception</dt>
<dd>The time limit is longer than 20 hours.</dd>
</dl>
    
<div class="note">
    
This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with [Success Criterion 3.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#on-focus), which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.</div>

###### Applying SC 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide#intent), replacing “page” with “non-web document or software” and “on the web page” with “in the non-web document or software”; removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference” in Note 2 of the success criterion; and adjusting Note 2 to avoid the use of the normative term "must".

With these substitutions, it would read:

**2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide:** For moving, [blinking](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-blinking), scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:

<dl>
<dt>Moving, blinking, scrolling</dt>
<dd>For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-pause)">pause</a>, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential">essential</a>; and</dd>
    
<dt>Auto-updating</dt>
<dd>For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.</dd>

With these substitutions, it would read:

**2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold:** <INS>**[[Non-web documents](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the [flash](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-flashes) is below the [general flash and red flash thresholds](#dfn-general-flash-and-red-flash-thresholds).

##### bypass-blocks

###### Applying SC 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written and described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/bypass-blocks#intent), replacing “web pages” with “non-web documents in a set of non-web documents” or “software programs in a set of software programs” to explicitly state that the multiple documents (or software programs) are part of a set rather than any two documents or pieces of software.

With these substitutions, this success criterion would read:

(for non-web documents)

**2.4.1 Bypass Blocks:** A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple <INS>**[[non-web documents](#document) in a [set of non-web documents](#set-of-documents)]**</INS>.

(for software programs)

**2.4.1 Bypass Blocks:** A mechanism is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple <INS>**[[software programs](#software) in a [set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs)]**</INS>.

<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
See [set of documents](#set-of-documents) and [set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs) in the Key Terms section to determine when a group of documents or software programs is considered a set for this success criterion.

With this substitution, it would read:

**2.4.3 Focus Order:** If <INS>**[[non-web documents](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> can be [navigated sequentially](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-navigated-sequentially) and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability.

This applies directly as written and described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.5](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/multiple-ways#intent), replacing “set of web pages” with “set of non-web documents” and “set of software programs”.

With these substitutions, this success criterion would read:

(for non-web documents)

**2.4.5 Multiple Ways:** More than one way is available to locate a <INS>**[[non-web document](#document)]**</INS> within a <INS>**[[set of non-web documents](#set-of-documents)]**</INS> except where the <INS>**[non-web document]**</INS> is the result of, or a step in, a [process](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-processes).

(for software programs)

**2.4.5 Multiple Ways:** More than one way is available to locate a <INS>**[[software program](#software)]**</INS> within a <INS>**[[set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs)]**</INS> except where the <INS>**[software program]**</INS> is the result of, or a step in, a [process](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-processes).

<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
See [set of documents](#set-of-documents) and [set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs) in the Key Terms section to determine when a group of documents or software programs is considered a set for this success criterion. (Sets of software that meet this definition appear to be extremely rare.) Those implementing this document (WCAG2ICT) will need to consider if this success criterion is appropriate to apply to non-web documents and software. See the [Interpretation of Web Terminology in a Non-web Context](#interpretation-of-web-terminology-in-a-non-web-context).</div><div class="note wcag2ict">

The definitions of “[set of documents](#set-of-documents)” and “[set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs)” in the Key Terms section are predicated on the ability to navigate from each element of the set to each other, and navigation is a type of locating. So the mechanism used to navigate between elements of the set will be one way of locating information in the set. Non-web environments, generally major operating systems with browse and search capabilities, often provide infrastructure and tools that provide mechanisms for locating content in a set of non-web documents or a set of software programs. For example, it may be possible to browse through the files or programs that make up a set, or search within members of the set for the names of other members. A file directory would be the equivalent of a site map for documents in a set, and a search function in a file system would be equivalent to a web search function for web pages. Such facilities may provide additional ways of locating information in the set.</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
An example of the use of “a software program that is part of process”, that would meet the exception for this success criterion, would be one where programs are interlinked but the interlinking depends on program A being used before program B, for validation or to initialize the dataset etc.</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
While some users may find it useful to have multiple ways to locate some groups of user interface elements within a document or software program, this is not required by the success criterion (and may pose difficulties in some situations).</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
The definitions of “[set of documents](#set-of-documents)” and “[set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs)” in WCAG2ICT require every item in the set to be independently reachable, and so nothing in such a set can be a “step in a process” that can't be reached any other way. The purpose of the exception—that items in a process are exempt from meeting this success criterion—is achieved by the definition of set.</div>

With these substitutions, it would read:

**2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum):** The size of the [target](#dfn-targets) for [pointer inputs](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-pointer-inputs) is at least 24 by 24 [CSS pixels](#dfn-css-pixels), except when:

Some compound documents and their user agents are designed to provide significantly different viewing and editing functionality depending upon what portion of the compound document is being interacted with (e.g. a presentation that contains an embedded spreadsheet, where the menus and toolbars of the user agent change depending upon whether the user is interacting with the presentation content, or the embedded spreadsheet content). If the user uses a mechanism other than putting focus on that portion of the compound document with which they mean to interact (e.g. by a menu choice or special keyboard gesture), any resulting [change of context](#dfn-change-of-context) wouldn't be subject to this success criterion because it was not caused by a change of focus.</div>

##### consistent-help

###### Applying SC 3.2.6 Consistent Help to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.2.6](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/consistent-help#intent), replacing "web page(s)" and "page(s)" with "non-web document(s) or software program(s)", "set of web pages" with "set of non-web documents or set of software programs", "page content" with "content", "on the page" with "in the non-web document or software", "page is serialized" with "non-web document or software content is serialized", "different page" with "different non-web document, software, or web page", and "page variation" with "content layout variation".

With these substitutions, it would read:

**3.2.6 Consistent Help:** If a **<INS>[[non-web document](#document) or [software](#software)]</INS>** contains any of the following help [mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism), and those mechanisms are repeated **<INS>[in multiple non-web documents or software]</INS>** within a **<INS>[[set of non-web documents](#set-of-documents) or [set of software programs](#set-of-software-programs)]</INS>**, they occur in the same order relative to other **<INS>[[content](#content-on-and-off-the-web)]</INS>**, unless a change is initiated by the user:

* Human contact details;
* Human contact mechanism;
* Self-help option;
* A fully automated contact mechanism

<div class="note">

Help mechanisms may be provided directly **<INS>[in the non-web document or software]</INS>**, or may be provided via a direct link to a **<INS>[different non-web document, software, or web page]</INS>** containing the information.</div>
<div class="note">
    
For this success criterion, "the same order relative to other **<INS>[content]</INS>**" can be thought of as how the content is ordered when the **<INS>[non-web document or software content is serialized]</INS>**. The visual position of a help mechanism is likely to be consistent across **<INS>[non-web documents or software]</INS>** for the same **<INS>[content layout variation]</INS>** (e.g., CSS break-point). The user can initiate a change, such as changing the **<INS>[non-web document’s or software's]</INS>** zoom or orientation, which may trigger a different **<INS>[content layout variation]</INS>**. This criterion is concerned with relative order across **<INS>[non-web documents or software]</INS>** displayed in the same **<INS>[content layout variation]</INS>** (e.g., same zoom level and orientation).</div>

With this substitution, it would read:

**3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data):** For <INS>**[[non-web documents](#document) or [software](#software)]**</INS> that cause [legal commitments](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-legal-commitments) or financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete [user-controllable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-user-controllable) data in data storage systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true:

##### accessible-authentication-minimum

###### Applying SC 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum) to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.8](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication-minimum.html), replacing “the website” with “a website, non-web document, or software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

**3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum):** A [cognitive function test](#dfn-cognitive-function-test) (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication [process](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-processes) unless that step provides at least one of the following:

<dl>
<dt>Alternative</dt>
<dd>Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.</dd>
<dt>Mechanism</dt>
<dd>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism">mechanism</a> is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.</dd>
<dt>Object Recognition</dt>
<dd>The cognitive function test is to recognize objects.</dd>
<dt>Personal Content</dt>
<dd>The cognitive function test is to identify <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-non-text-content">non-text content</a> the user provided to <INS><strong>[a website, <a href="#document">non-web document</a>, or <a href="#software">software</a>]</strong></INS>.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="note">

"Object recognition" and "Personal content" may be represented by images, video, or audio.</div>
<div class="note">

Examples of mechanisms that satisfy this criterion include: 
1. support for password entry by password managers to reduce memory need, and
2. copy and paste to reduce the cognitive burden of re-typing.</div>

(for non-web software)
<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
Any passwords used to unlock underlying [platform software](#platform-software) (running below the non-web software) are out of scope for this requirement since these are not under control of the non-web software’s author.</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">

There are cases where non-web software has an authentication process and no alternative or assistance mechanism is feasible, for example when entering a password when starting, powering on / turning on an ICT (device or otherwise).

### robust

#### Applying Principle 4 Robust to Non-Web Documents and Software

In WCAG 2, the Principles are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not used for conformance to WCAG. Principle 4 applies directly as written replacing “user agents, including assistive technologies” with “assistive technologies and accessibility features of software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

**Principle 4 Robust:** Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of <INS>**[[assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies) and accessibility features of software]**</INS>.

#### compatible

##### Applying Guideline 4.1 Compatible to Non-Web Documents and Software

In WCAG 2, the Guidelines are provided for framing and understanding the success criteria under them but are not used for conformance to WCAG. Guideline 4.1 applies directly as written, replacing “user agents, including assistive technologies” with “assistive technologies and accessibility features of software”.

With this substitution, it would read:

**Guideline 4.1 Compatible:** Maximize compatibility with current and future <INS>**[[assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies) and accessibility features of software]**</INS>.

##### parsing21

###### Applying SC 4.1.1 Parsing (WCAG 2.0 and 2.1) to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/parsing#intent), replacing “In content implemented using markup languages” with “For non-web documents or software that use markup languages, in such a way that the markup is separately exposed and available to assistive technologies and accessibility features of software or to a user-selectable user agent” and replacing the WCAG notes with notes applicable to non-web documents and software.

With this substitution, it would read:

<strong>4.1.1 Parsing:</strong> **<INS>[For [non-web documents](#document) or [software](#software) that use markup languages, in such a way that the markup is separately exposed and available to [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies) and accessibility features of software or to a user-selectable [user agent](#user-agent)]</INS>**, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.
<div class="note wcag2ict">

Markup is not always available to [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies) or to user selectable [user agents](#user-agent) such as browsers. Software sometimes uses markup languages internally for persistence of the software user interface, in ways where the markup is never available to assistive technology (either directly or through a document object model (DOM)), or to a user agent (such as a browser). In such cases, conformance to this provision would have no impact on accessibility as it can have for web content where it is exposed.

Accessibility issues introduced through poor markup would surface as errors in the programmatic information and would be reported using success criteria that rely on that information, such as 1.3.1 Info and Relationships and 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value.</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
This success criterion would be satisfied in cases where:

* Content is implemented using HTML or XML (as outlined in the [WCAG 2.1 note on 4.1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#h-note-27) and the [WCAG 2.0 editorial errata](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/errata/#editorial) in the thirteenth list item)
* Non-web documents or software are not authored using a markup language.
* Non-web documents or software are authored using a markup language, but accessibility information is exposed via platform accessibility APIs, not by making the markup itself available to assistive technologies.
</div>
<div class="example wcag2ict">

Examples where 4.1.1 Parsing would be satisfied:

* An HTML page embedded inside a desktop application (as outlined in the [WCAG 2.1 note on 4.1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#h-note-27) and the [WCAG 2.0 editorial errata](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/errata/#editorial) in the thirteenth list item)
* A PDF document (not authored using a markup language)
* Android or iOS apps which use a markup language to specify UI layout (accessibility information is exposed via platform accessibility APIs, not the markup)

Examples of markup that might be separately exposed and available to assistive technologies and to user agents include:

* LaTeX documents
* Markdown documents</div>

##### parsing22

###### Applying SC 4.1.1 Parsing (Obsolete and removed) (WCAG 2.2) to Non-Web Documents and Software

<div class="note wcag2ict">

WCAG 2.2 has made this success criterion obsolete and removed it as a requirement in the standard. Therefore, the interpretation of this success criterion for [non-web documents](#document) and [software](#software) has been removed.</div>

##### name-role-value

###### Applying SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value to Non-Web Documents and Software

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value#intent), replacing the note with: “This success criterion is primarily for software developers who develop or use custom user interface components. For example, standard user interface components on most accessibility-supported platforms already satisfy this success criterion when used according to specification.”

With this substitution, it would read:

**4.1.2 Name, Role, Value:** For all [user interface components](#dfn-user-interface-components) (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the [name](#dfn-name) and [role](#dfn-role) can be [programmatically determined](#dfn-programmatically-determinable); [states](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-states), properties, and values that can be set by the user can be [programmatically set](#dfn-programmatically-set); and notification of changes to these items is available to [user agents](#user-agent), including [assistive technologies](#dfn-assistive-technologies).

(for non-web documents)
<div class="note wcag2ict">

For document formats that support interoperability with assistive technology, standard user interface components often satisfy this success criterion when used according to the general design and accessibility guidance for the document format.</div>

(for non-web software)
<div class="note">
    
This success criterion is primarily for software developers who develop or use custom user interface components. Standard user interface components on most [accessibility-supported](#dfn-accessibility-supported) platforms already satisfy this success criterion when used according to specification.</div>
<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
For conforming to this success criterion, it is usually best practice for software user interfaces to use the [accessibility services of platform software](#accessibility-services-of-platform-software). These accessibility services enable interoperability between software user interfaces and both assistive technologies and accessibility features of software in standardized ways. Most platform accessibility services go beyond programmatic exposure of name and role, and programmatic setting of states, properties and values (and notification of same), and specify additional information that could be exposed and / or set (for instance, a list of the available actions for a given user interface component, and a means to programmatically execute one of the listed actions).</div>

<div class="note wcag2ict">
    
For [non-web documents](#document) and [software](#software) where status messages are not implemented using markup languages, there is still a user need to have status messages be programmatically exposed so that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus. This is typically enabled through the use of accessibility services of the [user agent](#user-agent) or [platform software](#platform-software).</div>
