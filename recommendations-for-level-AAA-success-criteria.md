Recommendations for Level AAA Success Criteria
-------------------------------------------
<div class="ednote">
  
The WCAG2ICT Task Force is in process of adding guidance for Level AAA success criteria. We are seeking feedback on the following sections:

- [1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)](#extended-audio-description-prerecorded)

The rest of the Level AAA criteria, as noted with editor's notes in the sections below, are still under development.</div>

The sections that follow contain guidance on applying the Level AAA success criteria from WCAG 2 to non-web documents and software. The text of each success criterion from WCAG 2 is copied as quoted text. Following that, the WCAG2ICT guidance is provided. The WCAG2ICT guidance can be found in the sections where the headings begin with "Applying..." to highlight that this is the content specific to this document. Within these sections custom notes added by WCAG2ICT are marked with the text "ADDED".

<div class="ednote">

**_This is where we could add a note with the overarching caveats regarding Level AAA criteria and the application of these SC to non-web documents and software. Here is the info in WCAG 2.2 regarding Level AAA conformance. We will need to have some proposals for what content would actually be included in here._**

From the <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#wcag-2-layers-of-guidance target="_blank">WCAG 2 Layers of Guidance</a> section of WCAG 2.2:

<blockquote>Note that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the cognitive, language, and learning areas. Authors are encouraged to consider the full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities, as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community. Metadata may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs.</blockquote>

From the  <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#cc1 target="_blank">Conformance level</a> section of WCAG 2.2: 
<div class="note">

<blockquote>It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA success criteria for some content.</blockquote></div></div>

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.2.7](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/extended-audio-description-prerecorded#intent).

<div class="note wcag2ict">

Audio descriptions (also called "video descriptions", "descriptive narration", and "described videos") describe important visual information needed to understand the video content, including text displayed in the video. Where the main audio track of the video fully describes important visual information, audio descriptions would not be needed at all as the requirement would already be met. When audio descriptions are needed, one way to implement them is by providing a second audio track for the audio-video media.</div>
