Text / Command-line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces
----------------------------------------------------------

Text applications are a class of software ICT that appeared decades ago, prior to the emergence of the graphical user interface (GUI) and the Web. The interface of a text application is generated using only text characters, and either a hardware terminal or a software terminal application handles the rendering of the text application—similar to how a web user agent handles the rendering of a web application. Text applications only accept text input, though some may also support the use of a mouse or other input devices. More recently, terminal applications which render text applications in the GUI may utilize spoken input through Automated Speech Recognition (ASR). Both GUI and native text environment interfaces also now commonly support word-completion prediction technologies. Command-line applications are a subset of text applications with further specific properties.

Historically, assistive technologies developed alongside text applications, making it possible for text applications to be accessible. Although there are far fewer new text applications being developed compared to new GUI or web applications, text applications remain in use today. In fact, command-line interfaces have seen a resurgence in recent years, especially in popular programming and revision tracking environments with continued development and greater functionality. In some cases this has precipitated renewed developments in assistive technology support for text applications.

Assistive technology support continues to evolve in today's text applications. Key examples include:

* In command line interfaces (CLI), support often includes context-sensitive help, so that help output following one command argument is different from the help provided following two arguments, and different still after three arguments. This helps users be more efficient and places no new requirements on assistive technologies.
* Output options generally include machine-readable structured text formats (such as JSON), in addition to the still powerful and widely used options of input/output redirection and piping. In these scenarios the assistive technology user can make use of the same range of output options as anyone else who finds the CLI environment compelling.
 
As noted in [Appendix B. Background on Text / Command-line / Terminal Applications and Interfaces](#background-on-text-command-line-terminal-applications-and-interfaces), applying WCAG to text / command-line applications involves understanding how text applications are rendered, how text applications have been made accessible via assistive technologies, and how to apply the concepts of “accessibility supported” and “programmatically determined” to text applications.
