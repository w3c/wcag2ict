Comments on Level AAA Success Criteria
-------------------------------------------
<div class="ednote">
  
The WCAG2ICT Task Force is in process of adding guidance for Level AAA success criteria. We are seeking feedback on the following sections:

- [1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)](#extended-audio-description-prerecorded)

The rest of the Level AAA criteria, as noted with editor's notes in the sections below, are still under development.</div>

The sections that follow contain guidance on applying the Level AAA success criteria from WCAG 2 to non-web documents and software. The text of each success criterion from WCAG 2 is copied as quoted text. Following that, the WCAG2ICT guidance is provided. The WCAG2ICT guidance can be found in the sections where the headings begin with "Applying..." to highlight that this is the content specific to this document. Within these sections custom notes added by WCAG2ICT are marked with the text "ADDED".

##### extended-audio-description-prerecorded

###### Applying SC 1.2.7 Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded) to Non-Web Documents and Software
  
This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.2.7](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/extended-audio-description-prerecorded#intent).

<div class="note wcag2ict">

Audio descriptions (also called "video descriptions", "descriptive narration", and "described videos") describe important visual information needed to understand the video content, including text displayed in the video. Where the main audio track of the video fully describes important visual information, audio descriptions would not be needed at all as the requirement would already be met. When audio descriptions are needed, one way to implement them is by providing a second audio track for the audio-video media.</div>
