Comments on Closed Functionality
--------------------------------

As noted in the Introduction, WCAG 2.2 assumes the presence of a “user agent” such as a browser, media player, or assistive technology as a means to access web content. Many of the success criteria in WCAG 2.2 assume web content will be accessed by ICT where assistive technologies can be connected to it or installed on it. The assistive technologies then present the web content to people with disabilities in an accessible form. 

ICT products with [closed functionality](#closed-functionality) do not allow the use of some assistive technologies for all of their functions. In many cases such ICT products also lack a “user agent” or its equivalent. As a result, ICT following the WCAG success criteria by themselves will not make information accessible on ICT with closed functionality. Where assistive technologies or user agents are not available to address the intent of these success criteria, something else needs to be provided or be required to facilitate accessibility as WCAG 2.2 intends. It is outside the [WCAG2ICT Task Force Work Statement](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/wcag2ict/work-statement) to say what the additional measures are, but this Note points out which success criteria depend on assistive technologies—and therefore would not work by themselves in products with closed functionality.

Several examples the task force has considered when developing guidance include the software of:

*   self-service transaction machines or kiosks - Examples include machines used for retail self-checkout, point of sales (POS) terminals, ticketing and self check-in, and automated banking machines.
*   telephony devices such as IP phones, feature phones, smartphones, and phone-enabled tablets
*   entertainment technologies including smart TVs, set-top boxes, smart displays, smart speakers, smart watches, and tablets
*   an ebook reader or standalone ebook software that allows assistive technologies to access all of the user interface controls of the ebook program (open functionality) but does not allow the assistive technologies to access the actual content of book (closed functionality).
*   an operating system that requires the user to provide log in credentials before it allows any assistive technologies to be loaded. The log-in portion would be closed functionality.
*   other technology devices, such as printers, displays, and iOt devices</div>

There are existing standards that provide accessibility requirements for both hardware and software aspects of closed functionality products. This document does not comment on those standards, but does note that WCAG success criteria should not be used as requirements for hardware aspects of closed functionality products. Instead, this Note indicates considerations for applying WCAG criteria to closed functionality software and when that might be problematic due to the underlying assumptions built into the WCAG criteria. See [Appendix A: Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality](#success-criteria-problematic-for-closed-functionality) for a list of success criteria for which this is relevant.
