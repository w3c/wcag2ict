As a result,  information rendered in electronic text can be presented in whatever form best meets  the needs of the user.

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by non-text content  accessible through the use of a text alternative. Text alternatives are a primary  way for making information accessible because they can be rendered through any sensory  modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user.  Providing text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of  ways by a variety of user agents. For example, a person who cannot see a picture can  have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech. A person who cannot  hear an audio file can have the text alternative displayed so that he or she can read  it. In the future, text alternatives will also allow information to be more easily  translated into sign language or into a simpler form of the same language.  </p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>  Note on CAPTCHA  </h3>  <p>  CAPTCHAs are a controversial topic in the accessibility community. As is described in the  paper <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/\">Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a>, CAPTCHAs intrinsically push the edges of human abilities in an attempt to defeat  automated processes. Every type of CAPTCHA will be unsolvable by users with certain  disabilities. However, they are widely used, and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  Working Group believes that if CAPTCHAs were forbidden outright, Web sites would choose  not to conform to WCAG rather than abandon CAPTCHA. This would create barriers for  a great many more users with disabilities. For this reason the Working Group has chosen  to structure the requirement about CAPTCHA in a way that meets the needs of most people  with disabilities, yet is also considered adoptable by sites. Requiring two different  forms of CAPTCHA on a given site ensures that most people with disabilities will find  a form they can use.  </p>  <p>Because some users with disabilities will still not be able to access sites that meet  the minimum requirements, the Working Group provides recommendations for additional  steps. Organizations motivated to conform to WCAG should be aware of the importance  of this topic and should go as far beyond the minimum requirements of the guidelines  as possible. Additional recommended steps include:  </p>  <ul>  <li>Providing more than two modalities of CAPTCHAs</li>  <li>Providing access to a human customer service representative who can bypass CAPTCHA</li>  <li>Not requiring CAPTCHAs for authorized users</li>  </ul>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Additional information</h3>  <p>Non-text content can take a number of forms, and this Success Criterion specifies  how each is to be handled.  </p>  <p> <strong>  For non-text content that is not covered by one of the other situations listed below,  </strong>  such as charts, diagrams, audio recordings, pictures, and animations, text alternatives  can make the same information available in a form that can be rendered through any  modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile). Short and long text alternatives  can be used as needed to convey the information in the non-text content. Note that  <strong>  prerecorded  audio-only  </strong> and <strong> prerecorded  video-only  </strong> files are covered here. <strong>  Live-audio-only  </strong> and <strong>  Live-video-only  </strong> files are covered below (see 3rd paragraph following this one). </p>  <p> <strong>  For non-text content that is a control or accepts user input  </strong>, such as images used as submit buttons, image maps or complex animations, a name  is provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content so that the person at  least knows what the non-text content is and why it is there.  </p>  <p> <strong>  Non-text content that is time-based media  </strong>  is made accessible through <a href=\"time-based-media\">1.2: Time-Based Media</a>. However, it is important that users know what it is when they encounter it on a  page so they can decide what action if any they want to take with it. A text alternative  that describes the time-based media and/or gives its title is therefore provided.  </p>  <p> <strong>  For Live Audio-only and live video-only content  </strong>, it can be much more difficult to provide text alternatives that provide equivalent  information as live audio-only and live video-only content. For these types of non-text  content, text alternatives provide a descriptive label. </p>  <p> <strong>  Sometimes a test or exercise must be partially or completely presented in non-text  format.  </strong> Audio or visual information is provided that cannot be changed to text because the  test or exercise must be conducted using that sense. For example, a hearing test  would be invalid if a text alternative were provided. A visual skill development  exercise would similarly make no sense in text form. And a spelling test with text  alternatives would not be very effective. For these cases, text alternatives should  be provided to describe the purpose of the non-text content; of course, the text alternatives  would not provide the same information needed to pass the test. </p>  <p> <strong>  Sometimes content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience  </strong> that words cannot fully capture. Examples include a symphony performance, works of  visual art etc. For such content, text alternatives at least identify the non-text  content with a descriptive label and where possible, additional descriptive text.  If the reason for including the content in the page is known and can be described  it is helpful to include that information. </p>  <p> <strong>Sometimes there are non-text exercises that are used to prove you are human.</strong> To avoid spam robots and other software from gaining access to a site a device called  a CAPTCHA is used. These usually involve visual or auditory tasks that are beyond  the current capabilities of Web robots. Providing a text alternative to them would  however make them operable by Robots, thus defeating their purpose. In this case a  text alternative would describe the purpose of the CAPTCHA, and alternate forms using  different modalities would be provided to address the needs of people with different  disabilities.  </p>  <p> <strong>  Sometimes there is non-text content that really is not meant to be seen or understood  by the user.  </strong> Transparent images used to move text over on a page; an invisible image that is used  to track usage statistics; and a swirl in the corner that conveys no information but  just fills up a blank space to create an aesthetic effect are all examples of this.  Putting alternative text on such items just distracts people using screen readers  from the content on the page. Not marking the content in any way, though, leaves users  guessing what the non-text content is and what information they may have missed (even  though they have not missed anything in reality). This type of non-text content, therefore,  is marked or implemented in a way that assistive technologies (AT) will ignore it  and not present anything to the user.  </p>  </section>",

These are covered because interaction must take place  at a particular time.

The option at Level A to provide an alternative for time-based  media instead of audio description for synchronized media would allow access to all  of the information in the synchronized media. This option also allows access to the  visual information in non-visual form when audio description is not provided for some  other reason. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For synchronized media that includes interaction, interactive elements (for example  links) could be embedded in the alternative for time-based media. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This guideline also includes (at Level AAA) sign language interpretation for synchronized  media as well as an approach called extended audio description. In extended audio  description, the video is frozen periodically to allow more audio description to take  place than is possible in the existing pauses in the dialogue. This is a case where  higher-level Success Criteria build upon the requirements of lower-level Success Criterion  with the intention of having cumulative, progressively stronger, requirements. </p>",

This  Success Criterion describes two approaches, either of which can be used.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">One approach is to provide audio description of the video content. The audio description  augments the audio portion of the presentation with the information needed when the  video portion is not available. During existing pauses in dialogue, audio description  provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, and on-screen text  that are important and are not described or spoken in the main sound track.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The second approach involves providing all of the information in the synchronized  media (both visual and auditory) in text form. An alternative for time-based media  provides a running description of all that is going on in the synchronized media content.  The alternative for time-based media reads something like a screenplay or book. Unlike  audio description, the description of the video portion is not constrained to just  the pauses in the existing dialogue. Full descriptions are provided of all visual  information, including visual context, actions and expressions of actors, and any  other visual material. In addition, non-speech sounds (laughter, off-screen voices,  etc.) are described, and transcripts of all dialogue are included. The sequence of  description and dialogue transcripts are the same as the sequence in the synchronized  media itself. As a result, the alternative for time-based media can provide a much  more complete representation of the synchronized media content than audio description  alone.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">If there is any interaction as part of the synchronized media presentation (e.g.,  \"press now to answer the question\") then the alternative for time-based media would  provide hyperlinks or whatever is needed to provide the same functionality.  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>  For 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7, if all of the information in the video track is already  provided in the audio track, no audio description is necessary. </p>  <p>  1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8 overlap somewhat with each other. This is to give the author  some choice at the minimum conformance level, and to provide additional requirements  at higher levels. At Level A in Success Criterion 1.2.3, authors do have the choice  of providing either an audio description or a full text alternative. If they wish  to conform at Level AA, under Success Criterion 1.2.5 authors must provide an audio  description - a requirement already met if they chose that alternative for 1.2.3,  otherwise an additional requirement. At Level AAA under Success Criterion 1.2.8 they  must provide an extended text description. This is an additional requirement if both  1.2.3 and 1.2.5 were met by providing an audio description only. If 1.2.3 was met,  however, by providing a text description, and the 1.2.5 requirement for an audio description  was met, then 1.2.8 does not add new requirements.  </p>  </div><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">See also <a href=\"audio-description-prerecorded\">1.2.2: Audio Description (Prerecorded)</a>, <a href=\"extended-audio-description-prerecorded\">1.2.2: Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)</a> and <a href=\"media-alternative-prerecorded\">1.2.3: Media Alternative (Prerecorded)</a>.  </p>",

This is done by providing an alternative for time-based media.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This approach involves providing all of the information in the synchronized media  (both visual and auditory) in text form. An alternative for time-based media provides  a running description of all that is going on in the synchronized media content. The  alternative for time-based media reads something like a book. Unlike audio description,  the description of the video portion is not constrained to just the pauses in the  existing dialogue. Full descriptions are provided of all visual information, including  visual context, actions and expressions of actors, and any other visual material.  In addition, non-speech sounds (laughter, off-screen voices, etc.) are described,  and transcripts of all dialogue are included. The sequence of descriptions and dialogue  transcripts is the same as the sequence in the synchronized media itself. As a result,  the alternative for time-based media can provide a much more complete representation  of the synchronized media content than audio description alone.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">If there is any interaction as part of the synchronized media presentation (e.g.,  \"press now to answer the question\") then the alternative for time-based media would  provide hyperlinks or whatever is needed to provide parallel functionality.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Individuals whose vision is too poor to reliably read captions and whose hearing is  too poor to reliably hear dialogue can access the alternative for time-based media  by using a refreshable braille display.  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>  For 1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.7, if all of the information in the video track is already  provided in the audio track, no audio description is necessary. </p>  <p>  1.2.3, 1.2.5, and 1.2.8 overlap somewhat with each other.

If they wish  to conform at Level AA, under Success Criterion 1.2.5 authors must provide an audio  description - a requirement already met if they chose that alternative for 1.2.3,  otherwise an additional requirement. At Level AAA under Success Criterion 1.2.8 they  must provide an extended text description. This is an additional requirement if both  1.2.3 and 1.2.5 were met by providing an audio description only. If 1.2.3 was met,  however, by providing a text description, and the 1.2.5 requirement for an audio description  was met, then 1.2.8 does not add new requirements.  </p>  </div>",

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that information and relationships  that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are preserved when the presentation  format changes. For example, the presentation format changes when the content is read  by a screen reader or when a user style sheet is substituted for the style sheet provided  by the author.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  Sighted users perceive structure and relationships through various visual cues  — headings are often in a larger, bold font separated from paragraphs by blank lines;  list items are preceded by a bullet and perhaps indented; paragraphs are separated  by a blank line; items that share a common characteristic are organized into tabular  rows and columns; form fields may be positioned as groups that share text labels;  a different background color may be used to indicate that several items are related  to each other; words that have special status are indicated by changing the font family  and /or bolding, italicizing, or underlining them; items that share a common characteristic  are organized into a table where the relationship of cells sharing the same row or  column and the relationship of each cell to its row and/or column header are necessary  for understanding; and so on. Having these structures and these relationships programmatically  determined or available in text ensures that information important for comprehension  will be perceivable to all.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Auditory cues may be used as well. For example, a chime might indicate the beginning  of a new section; a change in voice pitch or speech rate may be used to emphasize  important information or to indicate quoted text; etc.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  When such relationships are perceivable to one set of users, those relationships can  be made to be perceivable to all. One method of determining whether or not information  has been properly provided to all users is to access the information serially in different  modalities.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">If links to glossary items are implemented using anchor elements (or the proper link  element for the technology in use) and identified using a different font face, a screen  reader user will hear that the item is a link when the glossary term is encountered  even though they may not receive information about the change in font face. An on-line  catalog may indicate prices using a larger font colored red. A screen reader or person  who cannot perceive red, still has the information about the price as long as it is  preceded by the currency symbol.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Some technologies do not provide a means to programmatically determine some types  of information and relationships. In that case then there should be a text description  of the information and relationships. For instance, \"all required fields are marked  with an asterisk (*)\". The text description should be near the information it is describing  (when the page is linearized), such as in the parent element or in the adjacent element.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">There may also be cases where it may be a judgment call as to whether the relationships  should be programmatically determined or be presented in text. However, when technologies  support programmatic relationships, it is strongly encouraged that information and  relationships be programmatically determined rather than described in text.  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>It is not required that color values be programmatically determined. The information  conveyed by color cannot be adequately presented simply by exposing the value. Therefore,  <a href=\"use-of-color\" class=\"guideline\">Success Criterion 1.4.1  </a> addresses the specific case of color, rather than Success Criterion 1.3.1.  </p>  </div>",

For example, if a page contains two independent articles, the relative order of the  articles may not affect their meaning, as long as they are not interleaved.

The order of the article and the sidebars does not affect their meaning.

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content displays in the orientation (portrait or landscape) preferred by the user. Some websites and applications automatically set and restrict the screen to a particular display orientation and expect  that users will respond by rotating their device to match, but this can create problems. Some users have their devices mounted  in a fixed orientation (e.g. on the arm of a power wheelchair). Therefore, websites and applications need to support both orientations  by not restricting the orientation. Changes in content or functionality due to the size of display are not covered by this criterion which is focused on restrictions of orientation.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Historically, devices tended to have a fixed-orientation display, and all content was created to match that display orientation. Today, most handhelds and many other devices (e.g., monitors) have a hardware-level ability to dynamically adjust default display orientation based on sensor information. The goal of this Success Criterion is that authors should never restrict content's orientation, thus ensuring that it always match the device display orientation.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">It is important to distinguish between an author's responsibility not to restrict content to a specific orientation, and device-specific settings governing the locking of display orientation.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Many hand-held devices offer a mechanical switch or a system setting (or both) to allow the user to lock the device display to a specific orientation. Where a user decides to lock their entire device to an orientation, all applications are expected to pick up that setting and to display content accordingly.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This Success Criterion complements device \"lock orientation\" settings. A web page that does not restrict its display orientation will always support the system-level orientation setting, since the system setting is picked up by the user agent. Alternatively, where a device-level orientation lock is not in place, the user agent should display the page according to the orientation of the device (either its default, or the current orientation determined by any device sensors).</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The exception for things considered essential is aimed at situations where the content would only be understood in a particular orientation, or where the technology restricts the possible orientations. If content is aimed at a specific environment which is only available in one orientation (such as a television) then the content can restrict the orientation. Technologies such as virtual reality use screens within goggles that cannot change orientation relative to the user's eyes.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"benefits\">  <h3>Benefits</h3>  <ul>  <li>Users with dexterity impairments, who have a mounted device will be able to use the content in their fixed orientation.</li>  <li>Users with low-vision will be able to view content in the orientation that works best for them, for example to increase the text size by viewing content in landscape.</li>  </ul>  </section>",

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that the purpose of a form input collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined, so that user agents can extract and present this purpose to users using different modalities. The ability to programmatically declare the specific kind of data expected in a particular field makes filling out forms easier, especially for people with cognitive disabilities.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Appropriate visible labels and instruction can help users understand the purpose of form input fields, but users may benefit from having fields that collect specific types of information be rendered in an unambiguous, consistent, and possibly customized way for different modalities - either through defaults in their user agent, or through the aid of assistive technologies.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For some input fields, the type attribute already offers a way to broadly specify the intention of the input field, for example, input type=\"tel\", input type=\"email\", or input type=\"password\". However, these are only very broad categories, describing the type of input, but not necessarily its purpose, especially as it relates to user-specific input fields. As an example, type=\"email\" indicates that the field is for an e-mail address but does not clarify if the purpose is for entering the user's e-mail address or some other person's e-mail.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This success criterion defines the types of user interface component input purposes, found in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes\">Section 7 of the WCAG 2.1 Recommendation</a>, that must be programmatically identifiable. When these user input purposes are present, and if the technology supports doing so, the field purpose must be programmatically identifiable.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The HTML autocomplete attribute only accepts a certain number of specific well-defined fixed values. This allows a more fine-grained definition or identification of purpose than the type attribute, for example, by allowing the author to specify a specific type of name: Name (autocomplete=\"name”), Given Name (autocomplete=\"given-name”), Family Name (autocomplete=\"family-name”), as well as Username (autocomplete=\"username”), and Nickname (autocomplete=\"nickname”).</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">By adopting and repurposing this predefined taxonomy of definitions, user agents and assistive technologies can now present the purpose of the inputs to users in different modalities. For example, assistive technologies may display familiar icons next to input fields to help users who have difficulties reading. An icon of a birthday cake may be shown in front of an input field with autocomplete=\"bday\", or the icon of a telephone in front of an input field with autocomplete=\"tel\".</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">In addition to repurposing this taxonomy, when the autocomplete attribute technique is used to meet this Success Criterion, browsers and other user agents can suggest and 'autofill' the right content by autocompleting these fields based on past user input stored in the browser. By defining more granular definitions of common input purposes, for example “Birthday” (autocomplete=”bday”), browsers can store personalized values for each of these fields (the user's birthday date). The user is relieved of having to type the information and can instead confirm or, if needed, change the value of the field, a significant benefit for users with memory issues, dyslexia, and other disabilities. Because the autocomplete values are independent of language, users that may not be familiar with the text used to visually identify user input fields (the label) can still have that purpose consistently identified to them due to the fixed taxonomy of terms.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">If an input field accepts two different types of input purpose (as in combined user name/user email fields) and the technology used does not allow multiple purpose values to be defined, it is valid to provide either one or the other value or leave out the designation of input purpose altogether.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">When the user agent and assistive technology support for other metadata formats matures, metadata schemes like the <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/personalization-semantics/content/\">Personalization Semantics Content Module</a> may be used in addition or instead of the HTML autocomplete attribute to identify the purpose of input fields. They can also support automated adaptations that identify and match author-provided input labels to defined vocabularies or symbols that are used instead for labelling inputs.</p>",

It is achieved by adding semantics or metadata that provide this context. It is similar to adding role information (as required by 4.1.2) but instead of providing information about what the UI component is (such as an image) it provides information about what the component represents (such as a link to the home page).</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Identifying regions of the page allows people to remove or highlight regions with their user agent.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Products for people who are non-vocal often use symbols to help users communicate.

When users' symbols are mapped to the same nodes, then user agents can load the user-understandable symbol. People can then buy the symbols and use them across different devices or applications.

If the information is conveyed through color differences  in an image (or other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color  deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with color through  another visual means ensures users who cannot see color can still perceive the information.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Color is an important asset in design of Web content, enhancing its aesthetic appeal,  its usability, and its accessibility. However, some users have difficulty perceiving  color. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older  users do not see color well. In addition, people using limited-color or  monochrome displays and browsers will be unable to access information that is presented  only in color.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Examples of information conveyed by color differences: “required fields are red\",  “error is shown in red\", and “Mary's sales are in red, Tom's are in blue\". Examples  of indications of an action include: using color to indicate that a link will open  in a new window or that a database entry has been updated successfully. An example  of prompting a response would be: using highlighting on form fields to indicate that  a required field had been left blank.  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>This should not in any way discourage the use of color on a page, or even color coding if it is complemented by other visual indication.  </p>  </div><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">   <p>If content is conveyed through the use of colors that differ not only in their hue,  but that also have a significant difference in lightness, then this counts as an additional  visual distinction, as long as the difference in relative luminance between the colors leads  to a contrast ratio of 3:1 or greater.  For example, a light green and a dark red differ <strong>both</strong> by color (hue)  <strong>and</strong> by lightness, so they would pass if the contrast ratio is at least 3:1.  Similarly, if content is distinguished by inverting an element's foreground and background colors,  this would pass (again, assuming that the foreground and background colors have a sufficient contrast).  </p>  <p>However, if content relies on the user's ability to accurately perceive or differentiate a particular color  an additional visual indicator will be required regardless of the contrast ratio between those colors. For example, knowing whether an outline is green for valid or red for invalid.  </p>   </div><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">   <p>This criterion does not directly address the needs of users with assistive technologies.  It aims to ensure that sighted users who cannot distinguish between some colors can still  understand content.  How information is conveyed to assistive technology users is covered separately in other  criteria, including (but not limited to)  <a href=\"non-text-content\">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a>,  <a href=\"info-and-relationships\">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>, and  <a href=\"name-role-value\">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>.  </p>  <p>Conversely, even if information that is conveyed by color differences is appropriately conveyed  to assistive technologies, it does not necessarily pass this criterion, as sighted users who cannot  distinguish between certain color may not necessarily be using any assistive technologies. This  criterion requires a visible alternative to color.  </p>   </div><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">   <p>Most user agents provide users with a color-only cue that a link has been previously activated by them (\"visited\"). However, several technical constraints result in authors having very limited control over these color-only indications of visited links. The technical constraints are as follows:  <ol>  <li> User agents constrain the exposure of a link's visited state due to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Privacy_and_the_:visited_selector\">privacy concerns</a>. Author queries to user agents will indicate all links have not been visited.  </li>  <li>  Any available information on the visited state of a link would be inaccurate since it is both user and browser-dependent. Even if an author could accurately get information on previously activated links by a certain user, the author would be constrained to the current browser's preserved history, and would be unable to determine if the user had visited the page using a different browser (or if the history was not preserved, either from cache clearing or use of private sessions).  </li>  <li>  Authors can <em>only</em> use color to modify the <code>:visited</code> CSS pseudoclass style. The technology constrains any non-color styling. Due to palette limitations, an author cannot use color alone to achieve 3:1 contrast between link and non-link text as well as between visited and unvisited links while also achieving 4.5:1 contrast for all link and non-link text.  </li>  <li>  Authors also cannot set the visited state of links. The anchor element does not include a \"visited\" attribute; therefore the author has no ability to alter the state through an attribute setting. As such, authors cannot achieve <a href=\"info-and-relationships\">1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a> or  <a href=\"name-role-value\">4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a> in regard to visited links.  </li> </ol>  </p>   <p>For these reasons, setting or conveying a link's visited status is not an author responsibility. Where color alone distinguishes between visited and unvisited links, it does not result in a failure of this Success Criterion, even where the contrast between the two link colors is below 3:1. Note that authors must continue to ensure that all text links meet contrast minimums against the page background (SC 1.4.3).</p>  </div>",

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and  its background so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision (who do  not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). For people without color deficiencies,  hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading  performance (Knoblauch et al., 1991). Color deficiencies can affect luminance contrast  somewhat. Therefore, in the recommendation, the contrast is calculated in such a way  that color is not a key factor so that people who have a color vision deficit will  also have adequate contrast between the text and the background.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded. For example, if random  words are used to create a background and the words could be rearranged or substituted  without changing meaning, then it would be decorative and would not need to meet this  criterion. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast.  The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower. This allows authors to  use a wider range of color choices for large text, which is helpful for design of  pages, particularly titles. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large  enough to require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the  Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress Guidelines for Large  Print under <a href=\"#resources\">Resources</a>). \"18 point\" and \"bold\" can both have different meanings in  different fonts but, except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since there  are so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a note regarding thin or unusual  fonts is included in the definition for <a>large-scale</a> text.  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>When evaluating this Success Criterion, the font size in points should be obtained  from the user agent or calculated on font metrics in the way that user agents do.  Point sizes are based on the CSS <code>pt</code> size as defined in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#reference-pixel\">CSS3 Values</a>. The ratio between  sizes in points and CSS pixels is <code>1pt = 1.333px</code>, therefore <code>14pt</code>  and <code>18pt</code> are equivalent to approximately <code>18.5px</code> and <code>24px</code>.  </p>  <p>Because different image editing applications default to different pixel densities  (e.g., <code>72ppi</code> or <code>96ppi</code>), specifying point sizes for fonts from within an  image editing application can be unreliable when it comes to presenting text at a specific size.  When creating images of large-scale text, authors should ensure that the text in the  resulting image is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the  default size for body text. For example, for a <code>72ppi</code> image, an author would need  to use approximately 19pt and 24pt font sizes in order to successfully present images  of large-scale text to a user. </p>  <p>The 3:1 and 4.5:1 contrast ratios referenced in this Success Criterion are intended to be  treated as threshold values. When comparing the computed contrast ratio to the Success Criterion  ratio, the computed values should not be rounded (e.g., 4.499:1 would not meet the 4.5:1 threshold).</p>  </div><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>Because authors do not have control over user settings for font smoothing/anti-aliasing, when evaluating this  Success Criterion, refer to the foreground and background colors obtained from the user agent, or the underlying  markup and stylesheets, rather than the text as presented on screen.</p>  <p>Due to anti-aliasing, particularly thin or unusual fonts may be rendered by user agents with a much fainter  color than the actual text color defined in the underlying CSS. This can lead to situations where text has  a contrast ratio that nominally passes the Success Criterion, but has a much lower contrast in practice.  In these cases, best practice would be for authors to choose a font with stronger/thicker lines,  or to aim for a foreground/background color combination that exceeds the normative requirements  of this Success Criterion.  </p>  </div><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The contrast requirements for text also apply to images of text  (text that has been rendered into pixels and then stored in an image format) - see  <a href=\"images-of-text\">Success Criterion 1.4.5: Images of Text</a>.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This requirement applies to situations in which images of text were intended to be  understood as text. Incidental text, such as in photographs that happen to include  a street sign, are not included. Nor is text that for some reason is designed to be  invisible to all viewers. Stylized text, such as in corporate logos, should be treated  in terms of its function on the page, which may or may not warrant including the content  in the text alternative. Corporate visual guidelines beyond logo and logotype are  not included in the exception.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">In this provision there is an exception that reads \"that are part of a picture that  contains significant other visual content,\". This exception is intended to separate  pictures that have text in them from images of text that are done to replace text  in order to get a particular look. </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate. It is also  harder to change foreground and background contrast and color combinations for images  of text, which is necessary for some users. Therefore, we suggest using text wherever  possible, and when not, consider supplying an image of higher resolution.  </p>  </div><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The minimum contrast Success Criterion (1.4.3) applies to text in the page, including  placeholder text and text that is shown when a pointer is hovering over an object  or when an object has keyboard focus. If any of these are used in a page, the text  needs to provide sufficient contrast.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Although this Success Criterion only applies to text, similar issues occur for content presented  in charts, graphs, diagrams, and other non-text-based information, which is covered by  <a href=\"non-text-contrast\">Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast</a>. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">See also <a href=\"contrast-enhanced\">1.4.6: Contrast (Enhanced)</a>.  </p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Rationale for the Ratios Chosen</h3>  <p>A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]]  for standard text and vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in this provision to account  for the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity, congenital  or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast sensitivity that typically  accompanies aging.  </p>  <p>The rationale is based on a) adoption of the 3:1 contrast ratio for minimum acceptable  contrast for normal observers, in the ANSI standard, and b) the empirical finding  that in the population, visual acuity of 20/40 is associated with a contrast sensitivity  loss of roughly 1.5 [[ARDITI-FAYE]]. A user with 20/40 would thus require a contrast ratio of  <code>3 * 1.5 = 4.5 to 1</code>. Following analogous empirical findings and the same logic,  the user with 20/80 visual acuity would require contrast of about 7:1.  </p>   <p>Hues are perceived differently by users with color vision deficiencies (both congenital  and acquired) resulting in different colors and relative luminance contrasts than  for normally sighted users. Because of this, effective contrast and readability are  different for this population. However, color deficiencies are so diverse that prescribing  effective general use color pairs (for contrast) based on quantitative data is not  feasible. Requiring good luminance contrast accommodates this by requiring contrast  that is independent of color perception. Fortunately, most of the luminance contribution  is from the mid and long wave receptors which largely overlap in their spectral responses.  The result is that effective luminance contrast can generally be computed without  regard to specific color deficiency, except for the use of predominantly long wavelength  colors against darker colors (generally appearing black) for those who have protanopia.  (We provide an advisory technique on avoiding red on black for that reason). For more  information see [[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1994]] [[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1996]] [[ARDITI]].  </p>  <div class=\"note\">  <p>Some people with cognitive disabilities require color combinations or hues that have  low contrast, and therefore we allow and encourage authors to provide mechanisms to  adjust the foreground and background colors of the content. Some of the combinations  that could be chosen may have contrast levels that will be lower than those those  specified here. This is not a violation of this Success Criterion, provided  there is a mechanism that will return to the required values set out here.  </p> </div>  <p>The contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was chosen for level AA because it compensated for the  loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent  to approximately 20/40 vision. (20/40 calculates to approximately 4.5:1.) 20/40 is  commonly reported as typical visual acuity of elders at roughly age 80. [[GITTINGS-FOZARD]] </p>  <p>The contrast ratio of 7:1 was chosen for level AAA because it compensated for the  loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent  to approximately 20/80 vision. People with more than this degree of vision loss usually  use assistive technologies to access their content (and the assistive technologies  usually have contrast enhancing, as well as magnification capability built into them).  The 7:1 level therefore generally provides compensation for the loss in contrast sensitivity  experienced by users with low vision who do not use assistive technology and provides  contrast enhancement for color deficiency as well.  </p>  <div class=\"note\">  <p>Calculations in [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]] are for body text. A relaxed contrast  ratio is provided for text that is much larger.</p>  </div>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Notes on formula</h3>  <p>Conversion from nonlinear to linear RGB values is based on IEC/4WD 61966-2-1 [[IEC-4WD]].</p>  <p>The formula (<code>L1/L2</code>) for contrast is based on [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]] standards.</p>  <p>The ANSI/HFS 100-1988 standard calls for the contribution from ambient light to be  included in the calculation of L1 and L2. The <code>.05</code> value used is based on Typical Viewing  Flare from [[IEC-4WD]].  </p>  <p>This Success Criterion and its definitions use the terms \"contrast ratio\" and \"relative  luminance\" rather than \"luminance\" to reflect the fact that Web content does not emit  light itself. The contrast ratio gives a measure of the relative luminance that would  result when displayed. (Because it is a ratio, it is dimensionless.)  </p>  <div class=\"note\">  <p>  Refer to <a href=\"#resources\">related resources</a> for a list of tools that utilize the contrast ratio  to analyze the contrast of Web content.  </p>  <p>See also <a href=\"focus-visible\">2.4.7: Focus Visible</a> for techniques for indicating keyboard focus.  </p>  </div>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"inactive-controls\">  <h3>Inactive User Interface Components</h3>   <p>User Interface Components that are not available for user interaction (e.g., a disabled control in HTML) are not required to meet contrast requirements.

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that visually rendered text, including  text-based controls (text characters that have been displayed so that they can be  seen [vs. text characters that are still in data form such as ASCII]) can be scaled  successfully so that it can be read directly by people with mild visual disabilities,  without requiring the use of assistive technology such as a screen magnifier. Users  may benefit from scaling all content on the Web page, but text is most critical. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The scaling of content is primarily a user agent responsibility. User agents that  satisfy <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/guidelines.html#tech-configure-text-scale\">UAAG 1.0 Checkpoint 4.1</a> allow users to configure text scale. The author's responsibility is to create Web  content that does not prevent the user agent from scaling the content effectively.  Authors may satisfy this Success Criterion by verifying that content does not interfere  with user agent support for resizing text, including text-based controls, or by providing  direct support for resizing text or changing the layout. An example of direct support  might be via server-side script that can be used to assign different style sheets.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The author cannot rely on the user agent to satisfy this Success Criterion for HTML  content if users do not have access to a user agent with zoom support. For example,  if they work in an environment that requires them to use IE 6.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">If the author is using a technology whose user agents do not provide zoom support,  the author is responsible to provide this type of functionality directly or to provide  content that works with the type of functionality provided by the user agent. If the  user agent doesn't provide zoom functionality but does let the user change the  text size, the author is responsible for ensuring that the content remains usable  when the text is resized. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Some user interface components that function as a label and require activation by  the user to access content are not wide enough to accommodate the label's content.  For example, in Web mail applications the subject column may not be wide enough to  accommodate every possible subject header, but activating the subject header takes  the user to the full message with the full subject header. In Web-based spreadsheets,  cell content that is too long to be displayed in a column can be truncated, and the  full content of the cell is available to the user when the cell receives focus. The  content of a user interface component may also become too wide in user interfaces  where the user can resize the column width. In this type of user interface component,  line wrapping is not required; truncation is acceptable if the component's full content  is available on focus or after user activation and an indication that this information  can be accessed, is provided to the user in some way besides the fact that it is truncated.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Content satisfies the Success Criterion if it can be scaled up to 200%, that is, up  to twice the width and height. Authors may support scaling beyond that limit, however,  as scaling becomes more extreme, adaptive layouts may introduce usability problems.  For example, words may be too wide to fit into the horizontal space available to them,  causing them to be truncated; layout constraints may cause text to overlap with other  content when it is scaled larger; or only one word of a sentence may fit on each line,  causing the sentence to be displayed as a vertical column of text that is difficult  to read. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The working group feels that 200% is a reasonable accommodation that can support a  wide range of designs and layouts, and complements older screen magnifiers that provide  a minimum magnification of 200%. Above 200%, zoom (which resizes text, images, and  layout regions and creates a larger canvas that may require both horizontal and vertical  scrolling) may be more effective than text resizing. Assistive technology dedicated  to zoom support would usually be used in such a situation and may provide better accessibility  than attempts by the author to support the user directly.  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate, and therefore  we suggest using text wherever possible.

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and  its background so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision (who do  not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). For people without color deficiencies,  hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading  performance (Knoblauch et al., 1991). Color deficiencies can affect luminance contrast  somewhat. Therefore, in the recommendation, the contrast is calculated in such a way  that color is not a key factor so that people who have a color vision deficit will  also have adequate contrast between the text and the background.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded. For example, if random  words are used to create a background and the words could be rearranged or substituted  without changing meaning, then it would be decorative and would not need to meet this  criterion. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast.  The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower. This allows authors to  use a wider range of color choices for large text, which is helpful for design of  pages, particularly titles. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large  enough to require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the  Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress Guidelines for Large  Print under <a href=\"#resources\">Resources</a>). \"18 point\" and \"bold\" can both have different meanings in  different fonts but, except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since there  are so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a note regarding thin or unusual  fonts is included in the definition for <a>large-scale</a> text.  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>When evaluating this Success Criterion, the font size in points should be obtained  from the user agent or calculated on font metrics in the way that user agents do.  Point sizes are based on the CSS <code>pt</code> size as defined in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#reference-pixel\">CSS3 Values</a>. The ratio between  sizes in points and CSS pixels is <code>1pt = 1.333px</code>, therefore <code>14pt</code>  and <code>18pt</code> are equivalent to approximately <code>18.5px</code> and <code>24px</code>.  </p>  <p>Because different image editing applications default to different pixel densities  (e.g., <code>72ppi</code> or <code>96ppi</code>), specifying point sizes for fonts from within an  image editing application can be unreliable when it comes to presenting text at a specific size.  When creating images of large-scale text, authors should ensure that the text in the  resulting image is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the  default size for body text. For example, for a <code>72ppi</code> image, an author would need  to use approximately 19pt and 24pt font sizes in order to successfully present images  of large-scale text to a user. </p>  <p>The 7:1 and 4.5:1 contrast ratios referenced in this Success Criterion are intended to be  treated as threshold values. When comparing the computed contrast ratio to the Success Criterion  ratio, the computed values should not be rounded (e.g., 4.499:1 would not meet the 4.5:1 threshold).</p>  </div><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>Because authors do not have control over user settings for font smoothing/anti-aliasing, when evaluating this  Success Criterion, refer to the foreground and background colors obtained from the user agent, or the underlying  markup and stylesheets, rather than the text as presented on screen.</p>  <p>Due to anti-aliasing, particularly thin or unusual fonts may be rendered by user agents with a much fainter  color than the actual text color defined in the underlying CSS. This can lead to situations where text has  a contrast ratio that nominally passes the Success Criterion, but has a much lower contrast in practice.  In these cases, best practice would be for authors to choose a font with stronger/thicker lines,  or to aim for a foreground/background color combination that exceeds the normative requirements  of this Success Criterion.  </p>  </div><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The contrast requirements for text also apply to images of text  (text that has been rendered into pixels and then stored in an image format) - see  <a href=\"images-of-text\">Success Criterion 1.4.5: Images of Text</a>.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This requirement applies to situations in which images of text were intended to be  understood as text. Incidental text, such as in photographs that happen to include  a street sign, are not included. Nor is text that for some reason is designed to be  invisible to all viewers. Stylized text, such as in corporate logos, should be treated  in terms of its function on the page, which may or may not warrant including the content  in the text alternative. Corporate visual guidelines beyond logo and logotype are  not included in the exception.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">In this provision there is an exception that reads \"that are part of a picture that  contains significant other visual content,\". This exception is intended to separate  pictures that have text in them from images of text that are done to replace text  in order to get a particular look. </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate. It is also  harder to change foreground and background contrast and color combinations for images  of text, which is necessary for some users. See <a href=\"images-of-text\">1.4.5: Images of Text</a>.  </p>  </div><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The minimum contrast Success Criterion (1.4.3) applies to text in the page, including  placeholder text and text that is shown when a pointer is hovering over an object  or when an object has keyboard focus. If any of these are used in a page, the text  needs to provide sufficient contrast.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Although this Success Criterion only applies to text, similar issues occur for content presented  in charts, graphs, diagrams, and other non-text-based information, which is covered by  <a href=\"non-text-contrast\">Success Criterion 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast</a>. </p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Rationale for the Ratios Chosen</h3>  <p>A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]] for standard text and vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in Success Criterion 1.4.3  to account for the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity,  congenital or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast sensitivity that  typically accompanies aging.  </p>  <p>The rationale is based on a) adoption of the 3:1 contrast ratio for minimum acceptable  contrast for normal observers, in the ANSI standard, and b) the empirical finding  that in the population, visual acuity of 20/40 is associated with a contrast sensitivity  loss of roughly 1.5 [[ARDITI-FAYE]]. A user with 20/40 would thus require a contrast ratio of 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 to 1. Following  analogous empirical findings and the same logic, the user with 20/80 visual acuity  would require contrast of about 7:1.  </p>  <p>Hues are perceived differently by users with color vision deficiencies (both congenital  and acquired) resulting in different colors and relative luminance contrasts than  for normally sighted users. Because of this, effective contrast and readability are  different for this population. However, color deficiencies are so diverse that prescribing  effective general use color pairs (for contrast) based on quantitative data is not  feasible. Requiring good luminance contrast accommodates this by requiring contrast  that is independent of color perception. Fortunately, most of the luminance contribution  is from the mid and long wave receptors which largely overlap in their spectral responses.  The result is that effective luminance contrast can generally be computed without  regard to specific color deficiency, except for the use of predominantly long wavelength  colors against darker colors (generally appearing black) for those who have protanopia.  (We provide an advisory technique on avoiding red on black for that reason). For more  information see [[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1994]] [[ARDITI-KNOBLAUCH-1996]] [[ARDITI]].  </p>  <div class=\"note\">  <p>Some people with cognitive disabilities require color combinations or hues that have  low contrast, and therefore we allow and encourage authors to provide mechanisms to  adjust the foreground and background colors of the content. Some of the combinations  that could be chosen may have contrast levels that will be lower than those  specified here. This is not a violation of this Success Criterion, provided  there is a mechanism that will return to the required values set out here.  </p> </div>  <p>The contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was chosen for level AA because it compensated for the  loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent  to approximately 20/40 vision. (20/40 calculates to approximately 4.5:1.) 20/40 is  commonly reported as typical visual acuity of elders at roughly age 80. [[GITTINGS-FOZARD]] </p>  <p>The contrast ratio of 7:1 was chosen for level AAA because it compensated for the  loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent  to approximately 20/80 vision. People with more than this degree of vision loss usually  use assistive technologies to access their content (and the assistive technologies  usually have contrast enhancing, as well as magnification capability built into them).  The 7:1 level therefore generally provides compensation for the loss in contrast sensitivity  experienced by users with low vision who do not use assistive technology and provides  contrast enhancement for color deficiency as well.  </p>  <div class=\"note\">  <p>Calculations in [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]] are for body text. A relaxed contrast  ratio is provided for text that is much larger.</p>  </div>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Notes on formula</h3>  <p>Conversion from nonlinear to linear RGB values is based on IEC/4WD 61966-2-1 [[IEC-4WD]].</p>  <p>The formula (<code>L1/L2</code>) for contrast is based on [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]] standards.</p>  <p>The ANSI/HFS 100-1988 standard calls for the contribution from ambient light to be  included in the calculation of L1 and L2. The <code>.05</code> value used is based on Typical Viewing  Flare from [[IEC-4WD]].  </p>  <p>This Success Criterion and its definitions use the terms \"contrast ratio\" and \"relative  luminance\" rather than \"luminance\" to reflect the fact that Web content does not emit  light itself. The contrast ratio gives a measure of the relative luminance that would  result when displayed. (Because it is a ratio, it is dimensionless.)  </p>  <div class=\"note\">  <p>  Refer to <a href=\"#resources\">related resources</a> for a list of tools that utilize the contrast ratio  to analyze the contrast of Web content.  </p>  <p>See also <a href=\"focus-visible\">2.4.7: Focus Visible</a> for techniques for indicating keyboard focus.  </p>  </div>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"inactive-controls\">  <h3>Inactive User Interface Components</h3>   <p>User Interface Components that are not available for user interaction (e.g., a disabled control in HTML) are not required to meet contrast requirements.

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that visually rendered text is  presented in such a manner that it can be perceived without its layout interfering  with its readability. People with some cognitive, language and learning disabilities  and some low vision users cannot perceive the text and/or lose their reading place  if the text is presented in a manner that is difficult for them to read. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">People with some visual or cognitive disabilities need to be able to select the color  of text and the color of the background. They sometimes choose combinations that  seem unintuitive to someone without that disability. Sometimes these combinations  have very low contrast. Sometimes only very specific color combinations work for  them. Control of color or other aspects of text presentation makes a huge difference  to their comprehension. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For people with some reading or vision disabilities, long lines of text can become  a significant barrier. They have trouble keeping their place and following the flow  of text. Having a narrow block of text makes it easier for them to continue on to  the next line in a block. Lines should not exceed 80 characters or glyphs (40 if  CJK), where glyphs are the element of writing in the writing system for the text. Studies  have shown that Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) characters are approximately twice  as wide as non-CJK characters when both types of characters are displayed with characteristics  that achieve the same readability, so the maximum line width for CJK characters is  half that of non-CJK characters.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">People with some cognitive disabilities find it difficult to track text where the  lines are close together. Providing extra space between lines and paragraphs allows  them to better track the next line and to recognize when they have reached the end  of a paragraph. It is best if there are several different options, for instance, space-and-a-half  and double spacing for line spacing. By space and a half within paragraphs we mean  that top of one line is 150% further from the top of the line below it than would  be true when the text is 'single spaced' (the default spacing for the font). By Paragraph  spacing that is 1.5 times larger than the line spacing we mean that the spacing from  the top of the last line of 1 paragraph is 250% farther from the Top of the first  line of the next paragraph (i.e., that there is a blank line between the two paragraphs  that is 150% of the single space blank line). </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">People with certain cognitive disabilities have problems reading text that is both  left and right justified. The uneven spacing between words in fully justified text  can cause \"rivers of white\" space to run down the page making reading difficult and  in some cases impossible. Text justification can also cause words to be spaced closely  together, so that it is difficult for them to locate word boundaries. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The resizing provision ensures that visually rendered text (text characters that have  been displayed so that they can be seen [vs. text characters that are still in data  form such as ASCII]) can be scaled successfully without requiring that the user  scroll left and right to see all of the content. When the content has been authored  so that this is possible, the content is said to reflow. This permits people with  low vision and people with cognitive disabilities to increase the size of the text  without becoming disoriented. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The scaling of content is primarily a user agent responsibility. User agents that  satisfy UAAG 1.0 Checkpoint 4.1 allow users to configure text scale. The author's  responsibility is to create Web content that does not prevent the user agent from  scaling the content and that allows the reflow of the content within the current  width of the viewport. See <a href=\"resize-text\">1.4.4: Resize Text</a> for additional discussion of resizing text. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The horizontal scrolling requirement is not intended to apply to small-screen devices  where long words may be displayed on a single line and require users to scroll horizontally.  For the purposes of this requirement, authors should ensure that content meets this  requirement on standard desktop/laptop displays with the browser window maximized.  Since people generally keep their computers for several years, it is best not to rely  on the latest desktop/laptop display resolutions but to consider the common desktop/laptop  display resolutions over the course of several years when making this evaluation.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Wrapping should always be possible as long as words are not so long that a single  word is more than half the width of a full screen. Very long URIs may run off the side of an enlarged screen, but they would not be considered text  for \"reading\" and, therefore, would not violate this provision.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This provision does not mean that a user would never need to use horizontal scrolling.  It only means that they would not need to use horizontal scrolling back and forth  to read a line of text. For example, if a page consisted of two equal sized columns  of text, it would automatically meet this provision. Enlarging the page would mean  that the first column was completely on screen and the user could just scroll vertically  down the page to read it. To read the second column, they would horizontally scroll  to the right, where the right hand column would then fit entirely within the width  of the screen, and read that column without further horizontal scrolling.  </p>",

It is acceptable to provide two-dimensional scrolling for such parts of the content.</p>",
			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to support people with low vision who need to enlarge text and read it in a single column. When the browser zoom is used to scale content to 400%, it reflows - i.e., it is presented in one column so that scrolling in more than one direction is not necessary.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For people with low vision, enlarged text with reflow enables reading. It is critical. Enlargement enables perception of characters. Reflow enables tracking. Tracking is following along lines of text, including getting from the end of one line to the beginning of the next line.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Avoiding the need to scroll in the direction of reading in order to reveal lines that are cut off by the viewport is important, because such scrolling significantly increases the effort required to read. It is also important that content is not hidden off-screen. For example, zooming into a vertically scrolling page should not cause content to be hidden to one side.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>How reflow works</h3>  <p>User agents for technologies such as HTML/CSS, PDF, and ePub have methods for reflowing content to fit the width of the window (viewport). When appropriately authored, page content can reflow (wrap) to stay within the window's boundaries (viewport) when users zoom in to enlarge the size of content. Spatial relationships of content may change when users zoom, but all information and functionality should continue to be available.</p>  <p>Supporting the reflow of content is also known as 'Responsive Web Design'. It is enabled by CSS media queries which reformat the web content for different viewport widths (at particular break points) in order to provide optimised layouts for mobile devices such as tablets or smartphones. Importantly, these breakpoints are not only triggered by narrower viewports, but also when users employ the browser zoom function to zoom into the page.</p>  <p>In a desktop browser at 100% (default) scale, typical web pages that support reflow display content in two, three or more columns. Zooming in will at some point trigger a change of layout, so content will now be displayed in fewer columns. At a higher magnification scale of 200% or more, content will usually be rendered in a single column. Parts of content that were in the marginal columns, like a navigation menu or supplementary content, will now typically appear on top of or below the main content.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Viewing distance and display resolution</h3>  <p>The value of 320 CSS pixels was chosen as a reasonable minimum size that authors can achieve. This value lines up with the reported viewport width of small displays of common mobile devices. The width of 320 CSS pixels exactly corresponds to a desktop browser window set to a width of 1280px and zoomed in to 400%. It should be noted that 400% applies to the dimension, not the area. It means four times the default width and four times the default height.</p> <figure id=\"figure-CSS-pixel-letter-4x\"><img src=\"img/css-pixel-by-device.png\" width=\"462\" height=\"198\" alt=\"Diagram showing the size of character needed by viewing distance to make the same image on the retina with small screen devices close, large screen devices further away.\"/>  <figcaption>A letter of the same CSS pixel size on different displays with different resolutions</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>When we read, the size of the print is not as important as the image it projects on the retina of our eye. Phones are designed for close viewing while desktops are designed for viewing farther away. As a consequence 16px print on a phone is physically smaller than 16px print on a desktop. This is not a problem because both print sizes cast the same image on our retina if they are viewed at their intended distance.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Visibility and availability of content</h3> <p>How much of the content is visible may change at different scales. For example, navigation menus that are fully visible in the desktop layout are often collapsed into fewer items, or even into a single menu button (the 'hamburger' icon pattern) so they take up less screen space.</p>  <p>The Success Criterion is met as long as all content and functionality are still fully available - either directly, or revealed via accessible controls, or accessible via direct links.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">   <h3>Content exceptions for reflow</h3>  <p>Content which requires two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning cannot reflow without loss of meaning, and is therefore excepted from the need to be presented without two-dimensional scrolling. For example, graphics and video are by their nature two-dimensional. Cutting up an image and stacking the blocks would render the content unusable. However, it <em>is</em> possible to have these elements stay within the bounds of viewport even as other content zooms to 400% (see advisory techniques).</p>  <p>Data tables have a two-dimensional relationship between the headings and data cells. This relationship is essential to convey the content. This Success Criterion therefore exempts data tables from needing to display without scrolling in the direction of text (e.g., horizontally in a vertically scrolling page). However, cells within data tables are not excepted unless the cell contains types of content that also requires two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.</p>  <p>Interfaces which provide toolbars to edit content need to show both the content and the toolbar in the viewport. Depending on the number of toolbar buttons, the toolbar may need to scroll in the direction of text.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Responsive web design and other ways to meet this Success Criterion</h3>  <p>Using the responsive web design approach is the most effective method of achieving the goal of allowing people to zoom in to 400%. Each variation (CSS break point) of the page at the same URL should conform (compare <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#h-note-27\">Conformance for WCAG 2.1</a>).</p>  <p>For organisations which are using legacy systems or are not able to update their layout methods for some reason, an alternative conforming version could be a mobile site which has a fixed 320px wide layout. The user should be able to find that version from the default website.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Avoiding scrolling in horizontally and vertically written languages</h3>  <p>The success Criterion applies to both horizontally and vertically written languages. Zooming the page for horizontally written languages where pages scroll vertically by default (e.g. English) should not require horizontal scrolling. Zooming the page for vertically written languages which scroll horizontally by default should not require vertical scrolling.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>The relation of Reflow to the Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text</h3>  <p>The focus of the Reflow Success Criterion is to enable users to zoom in without having to scroll in two directions. <a href=\"resize-text\" class=\"sc\">Success Criterion 1.4.4 Resize Text</a> also applies, so it should be possible to increase the size of all text to at least 200% while simultaneously meeting the reflow requirement. For most implementations, the text is expected to continue to enlarge as the magnification increases, so that users can magnify text up to (and beyond) 400%. In an implementation where text does not consistently increase its size as people zoom in (such as when it is transformed based on a media query to adapt to small-screen usage), it must still be possible to get to 200% enlargement in order to satisfy the Resize Text criterion.</p>  <p>For example, if at the default browser setting of 100% zoom, text is set at 20px when the window is 1280px wide, the same 20px at 200% zoom would mean a text size of 200%. At 400% zoom, the author may decide to set the text size to 10px: the text would now still be enlarged to 200% compared to the default browser setting of 100% zoom. It is not required to achieve 200% text enlargement at every breakpoint, but it should be possible to get 200% text enlargement in some way.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Browsers on mobile operating systems</h3>  <p>Most browsers on mobile operating systems do not combine reflow and zoom in the same way as on desktop browsers. These mobile browsers normally support reflow when changing the orientation of the device -- content will be adjusted to the new viewport width. However, these mobile browsers can only magnify content to achieve 1.4.4. Resize Text in manners which do not constrain reflow to a single dimension, for example by using a pinch gesture to scale up content or a double tap on a particular column to make it fill the viewport width. This means that zoomed content in most mobile browsers involves two-dimensional scrolling regardless of what an author does.</p>  <p>Mobile user agents <em>can</em> offer reflow when users zoom into content, as evidenced by the Dolphin browser for Android. The lack of magnified reflow support in browsers on mobile operating systems can therefore be regarded as a user agent support issue.</p>  </section>",

The requirements and rationale are similar to those for large text in <a href=\"contrast-minimum\">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Low contrast controls are more difficult to perceive, and may be completely missed by people with a visual impairment. Similarly, if a graphic is needed to understand the content or functionality of the webpage then it should be perceivable by people with low vision or other impairments without the need for contrast-enhancing assistive technology.</p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>The 3:1 contrast ratios referenced in this Success Criterion is intended to be treated as threshold values. When comparing the computed contrast ratio to the Success Criterion ratio, the computed values should not be rounded (e.g. 2.999:1 would not meet the 3:1 threshold).</p>  </div><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"user-interface-components\">  <h3>Active User Interface Components</h3>   <p>For active controls any visual information provided that is necessary for a user to identify that a control is present and how to operate it must have a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio with the adjacent colors. Also, any visual information necessary to indicate state, such as whether a component is selected or focused must also ensure that the information used to identify the control in that state has a minimum 3:1 contrast ratio.</p>  <p>This Success Criterion does not require that changes in color that differentiate between states of an individual component meet the 3:1 contrast ratio when they do not appear next to each other. For example, there is not a new requirement that visited links contrast with the default color, or that mouse hover indicators contrast with the default state. However, the component must not lose contrast with the adjacent colors, and non-text indicators such as the check in a checkbox, or an arrow graphic indicating a menu is selected or open must have sufficient contrast to the adjacent colors.</p>   <h4>Boundaries</h4>  <p>This success criterion does not require that controls have a visual boundary indicating the hit area, but if the visual indicator of the control is the only way to identify the control, then that indicator must have sufficient contrast. If text (or an icon) within a button or placeholder text inside a text input is visible and there is no visual indication of the hit area then the Success Criterion is passed. If a button with text also has a colored border, since the border does not provide the only indication there is no contrast requirement beyond the text contrast (<a href=\"contrast-minimum\">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>). Note that for people with cognitive disabilities it is recommended to delineate the boundary of controls to aid in the recognition of controls and therefore the completion of activities.</p>  <figure id=\"figure-buttons-no-visual-indicator\">  <img alt=\"Two buttons, the first with no visual indicator except text saying 'button'.

For example, if an input has a white internal background, dark border, and white external background the 'adjacent color' to the component would be the white external background.</p>  <figure id=\"figure-standard-text-adjacent-white\">  <img src=\"img/text-input-default.png\" alt=\"Standard text input with a label, white internal and external background with a dark border.\"/>  <figcaption>A standard text input with a grey border (#767676) and white adjacent color outside the component</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>If components use several colors, any color which does not interfere with identifying the component can be ignored for the purpose of measuring contrast ratio. For example, a 3D drop-shadow on an input, or a dark border line between contrasting backgrounds is considered to be subsumed into the color closest in brightness (perceived luminance).</p>   <p>The following example shows an input that has a light background on the inside and a dark background around it. The input also has a dark grey border which is considered to be subsumed into the dark background. The border does not interfere with identifying the component, so the contrast ratio is taken between the white background and dark blue background.</p>   <figure id=\"figure-text-box-dark-bg-light-border\">  <img alt=\"A text box with a dark background and light border, with a white background.\" src=\"img/text-input-background-border.png\"/>  <figcaption> The contrast of the input background (white) and color adjacent to the control (dark blue #003366) is sufficient. There is also a border (silver) on the component that is not required to contrast with either.</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>For visual information required to identify a state, such as the check in a checkbox or the thumb of a slider, that part might be within the component so the adjacent color might be another part of the component.</p>   <figure id=\"figure-purple-box-light-check\">  <img alt=\"A purple box with a light grey check.\" src=\"img/checkbox-purple.png\"/>  <figcaption> A customized checkbox with light grey check (#E5E5E5), which has a contrast ratio of 5.6:1 with the purple box (#6221EA).</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>It is possible to use a flat design where the status indicator fills the component and does not contrast with the component, but does contrast with the colors adjacent to the component.</p>    <figure id=\"figure-three-radios\">  <img alt=\"Four radio buttons, the first is a plain circle labelled 'Not selected'.

The principle is that contrast ratio (the difference in brightness) can be used to distinguish text or graphics. For example, <a href=\"../../techniques/general/G183.html\">G183</a> is a technique to use a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text to distinguish links and controls. In that case the Working Group regards a link color that meets the 3:1 contrast ratio relative to the non-linked text color as satisfying the Success Criterion <a href=\"use-of-color\">1.4.1 Use of color</a> since it is relying on contrast ratio as well as color (hue) to convey that the text is a link.</p>   <p>Non-text information within controls that uses a change of hue alone to convey the value or state of an input, such as a 1-5 star indicator with a black outline for each star filled with either yellow (full) or white (empty) is likely to fail the Use of color criterion rather than this one.</p>   <figure id=\"figure-two-star-ratings\">  <img src=\"img/star-examples-pass.png\" alt=\"Two star ratings, one uses a black outline (on white) with a black fill to indicate it is checked. The second has a yellow fill and a thicker dark border.\" width=\"300\"/>  <figcaption>  Two examples which pass this success criterion, using either a solid fill to indicate a checked-state that has contrast, or a thicker border as well as yellow fill.  </figcaption>  </figure>  <figure id=\"figure-two-star-ratings-failing\">  <img src=\"img/star-examples-fail.png\" alt=\"Two star ratings, the first uses 5 stars with a black outline and a yellow or white fill, where yellow indicates checked. The second uses only pale yellow stars on white.\" width=\"300\"/>  <figcaption>  Two examples which fail a success criterion, the first fails the Use of color criterion due to relying on yellow and white hues. The second example fails the Non-text contrast criterion due to the yellow (#FFF000) to white contrast ratio of 1.2:1.  </figcaption>  </figure>   <p>Using a change of contrast for focus and other states is a technique to differentiate the states.

Other cases include focus indicators which are:</p>   <ul>  <li>only inside the component and need to contrast with the adjacent color(s) within the component.</li>  <li>the border of the component (inside the component and adjacent to the outside) and need to contrast with both adjacent colours. </li>  <li>partly inside and partly outside, where either part of the focus indicator can contrast with the adjacent colors.</li>  </ul>   <figure id=\"figure-focus-inner\">  <img src=\"img/ntc-focus-inner.png\" alt=\"Three blue buttons, the middle has a thick yellow outline well inside the border of the button.\" width=\"400\"/>  <figcaption>  The internal yellow indicator (#FFFF00) contrasts with the blue button background (#4189B9), <strong>passing</strong> the criterion.  </figcaption>  </figure>    <figure id=\"figure-focus-outer-yellow\">  <img src=\"img/ntc-focus-outer-yellow.png\" alt=\"Three blue buttons on a white background, the middle has a light yellow outline outside of the botton's non-focused boundary.\" width=\"400\"/>  <figcaption>  The external yellow indicator (#FFFF00) does not contrast with the white background (#FFF) which the component is on, <strong>failing</strong> the criterion.  </figcaption>  </figure>   <figure id=\"figure-focus-outer-green\">  <img src=\"img/ntc-focus-outer-green.png\" alt=\"Three blue buttons on a white background, the middle has a dark green outline outside of the botton's non-focused boundary.\" width=\"400\"/>  <figcaption>  The external green indicator (#008000) does contrast with the white background (#FFF) which the component is on, <strong>passing</strong> the criterion.

Images made up of multiple lines, colors and shapes will be made of multiple graphical objects, some of which are required for understanding.</p>   <p>Not every graphical object needs to contrast with its surroundings - only those that are required for a user to understand what the graphic is conveying. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Pr.C3.A4gnanz\">Gestalt principles</a> such as the \"law of continuity\" can be used to ignore minor overlaps with other graphical objects or colors.</p>   <table class=\"data\">  <thead>  <tr>  <th>Image</th>  <th>Notes</th>  </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>  <tr>  <td><img src=\"img/contrast-phone.png\" alt=\"An orange circle with a white telephone icon in the middle.\" width=\"40\"/></td>  <td><p>The phone icon is a simple shape within the orange (#E3660E) circle.

If a person needs to perceive a graphic, or part of a graphic (a graphical object) in order to understand the content it should have sufficient contrast. However, that is not a requirement when:</p>  <ul>  <li>  <p>A graphic with text embedded or overlayed conveys the same information, such as labels <em>and</em> values on a chart.</p>  <p class=\"note\">Text within a graphic must meet <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum\">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>.</p>  </li>  <li> The graphic is for aesthetic purposes that does not require the user to see or understand it to understand the content or use the functionality.</li>  <li> The information is available in another form, such as in a table that follows the graph, which becomes visible when a \"Long Description\" button is pressed.</li>  <li> The graphic is part of a logo or brand name (which is considered \"essential\" to its presentation).</li>  </ul>  </section>  <section>  <h4>Gradients</h4>   <p>Gradients can reduce the apparent contrast between areas, and make it more difficult to test. The general principles is to identify the graphical object(s) required for understanding, and take the central color of that area. If you remove the adjacent color which does not have sufficient contrast, can you still identify and understand the graphical object?</p>  <figure id=\"figure-blue-circle-i-versions\">  <img src=\"img/contrast-gradient.png\" alt=\"Two versions of a blue circle with an 'i' indicating information.

In order for someone to discern the graphics exist at all, the unfocused default version must already have sufficiently contrasting colors or text. For the area that receives focus, information can then be made available dynamically as pop-up text, or be foregrounded dynamically by increasing the contrast.</p>   <!-- example from http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/jetCookbook.html?component=pieChart&demo=default -->  <figure id=\"figure-pie-slice-hover-data\">  <img alt=\"A pie chart with one slice highlighted and a box hovering next to it that shows the data and indicates the source in the key.\" src=\"img/dynamic-pie-chart.png\" width=\"350\"/> <figcaption>A dynamic chart where the current 'slice' is hovered or focused, which activates the associated text display of the values and highlights the series</figcaption>  </figure>  </section>  <section>  <h4>Infographics</h4>   <p>Infographics can mean any graphic conveying data, such as a chart or diagram. On the web it is often used to indicate a large graphic with lots of statements, pictures, charts or other ways of conveying data. In the context of graphics contrast, each item within such an infographic should be treated as a set of graphical objects, regardless of whether it is in one file or separate files.</p>   <p>Infographics often fail to meet several WCAG level AA criteria including:</p>   <ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-content.html\">1.1.1 Non-text Content</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html\">1.4.1 Use of Color</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html\">1.4.3 (Text) Contrast</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/images-of-text.html\">1.4.5 Images of Text</a></li>  </ul>   <p>An infographic can use text which meets the other criteria to minimise the number of graphical objects required for understanding. For example, using text with sufficient contrast to provide the values in a chart. A long description would also be sufficient because then the infograph is not relied upon for understanding.</p>   </section>  <section>  <h4>Essential Exception</h4>   <p>Graphical objects do not have to meet the contrast requirements when \"a particular presentation of graphics is essential to the information being conveyed\". The Essential exception is intended to apply when there is no way of presenting the graphic with sufficient contrast without undermining the meaning. For example:</p>  <ul>  <li><strong>Logotypes and flags</strong>: The brand logo of an organization or product is the representation of that organization and therefore exempt. Flags may not be identifiable if the colors are changed to have sufficient contrast.</li>  <li><strong>Sensory</strong>: There is no requirement to change pictures of real life scenes such as photos of people or scenery.</li>  <li><strong>Representing other things</strong>: If you cannot represent the graphic in any other way, it is essential. Examples include: <ul>  <li>Screenshots to demonstrate how a website appeared.</li>  <li>Diagrams of medical information that use the colors found in biology (<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Schematic_diagram_of_the_human_eye_it.svg\">example medical schematic from Wikipedia</a>).</li>  <li>color gradients that represent a measurement, such as heat maps (<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eyetracking_heat_map_Wikipedia.jpg\">example heatmap from Wikipedia</a>).</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  </section>   <section id=\"testing-principles\">  <h3>Testing Principles</h3>  <p>A summary of the high-level process for finding and assessing non-text graphics on a web page:</p>  <ul>  <li>Identify each user-interface component (link, button, form control) on the page and:  <ul>  <li>Identify the visual (non-text) indicators of the component that are required to identify that a control exists, and indicate the current state. In the default (on page load) state, test the contrast ratio against the adjacent colors.</li>  <li>Test those contrast indicators in each state.</li>  </ul>  </li>  <li>Identify each graphic on the page that includes information required for understanding the content (i.e. excluding graphics which have visible text for the same information, or are decorative) and:  <ul>  <li>Check the contrast of the graphical object against its adjacent colors;</li>  <li>If there are multiple colors and/or a gradient, choose the least contrasting area to test;</li>  <li>If it passes, move to the next graphical object;</li>  <li>If the least-contrasting area is less than 3:1, assume that area is invisible, is the graphical object still understandable?</li>  <li>If there is enough of the graphical object to understand, it passes, else fail.</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  <p>The techniques below each have testing criteria, and the related criteria for <a href=\"focus-visible\">Focus visible (2.4.7)</a>, <a href=\"use-of-color\">Use of color (1.4.1)</a>, and <a href=\"contrast-minimum\">Contrast minimum</a> also have techniques.</p>  </section>   </section>",

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion (SC) is to ensure that when people override author specified text spacing to improve their reading experience, content is still readable and operable. Each of the requirements stipulated in the SC's four bullets helps ensure text styling can be adapted by the user to suit their needs.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The specified metrics set a minimum baseline. The values in between the author's metrics and the metrics specified in this SC should not have loss of content or functionality.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This SC focuses on the adaptability of content to an increase in spacing between lines, words, letters, and paragraphs. Any combination of these may assist a user with effectively reading text. As well, ensuring that content correctly adapts when users override author settings for spacing also significantly increases the likelihood other style preferences can be set by the user. For example, a user may need to change to a wider font family than the author has set in order to effectively read text. </p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3 id=\"authorresp\">Author Responsibility </h3>  <p>This SC does not dictate that authors must set all their content to the specified metrics. Rather, it specifies that an author's content has the ability to be set to those metrics without loss of content or functionality. The author requirement is both to not interfere with a user's ability to override the author settings, and to ensure that content thus modified does not break content in the manners shown in figures 1 through 3 in Effects of Not Allowing for Spacing Override. The values in the SC are a baseline. Authors are encouraged to surpass the values specified, not see them as a ceiling to build to. If the user chooses to go beyond the metrics specified any resulting loss of content or functionality is the user's responsibility.</p>  <p>Further, this SC is not concerned with <em>how</em> users change the line height and spacing metrics. It does not require that content implement its own mechanisms to allow users to do this. It is not a failure of the content if a user agent or platform does not provide a way for users to do this. Content does not fail this SC if the method chosen by the user - for instance, the use of an extension or bookmarklet - fails to correctly set the line height and spacing text properties on the content (provided that the content is not actively and purposely preventing the properties from being added).</p>  <section>  <h4 id=\"applicability\">Applicability</h4>  <p>If the markup-based technologies being used are capable of overriding text to the Success Criterion's metrics, then this SC is applicable. For instance Cascading Style Sheet/HTML technologies are quite able to allow for the specified spacing metrics. Plugin technologies would need to have a built-in ability to modify styles to the specified metrics. Currently, this SC does not apply to PDF as it is not implemented using markup.</p>  <p>Examples of text that are typically not affected by <a>style properties</a> and not expected to adapt are:</p>  <ul>  <li>Video captions embedded directly into the video frames and not provided as an associated caption file</li>  <li><a>Images of text</a></li>  </ul>  <p>For this SC, <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#the-canvas-element\">canvas</a> implementations of text are considered to be <a>images of text</a>.</p>  </section>  <section>  <h4 id=\"ellipses\">Use of ellipses</h4>  <p>There may be regions of a page where text containers cannot expand due to design constraints (such as a maximum width for the left navigation or table column headers). A common convention if text exceeds its space is to replace truncated text with an ellipsis. Where ellipses appear as a result of modifying text style properties, the page can still meet the Text Spacing requirements, so long as the content is still available. For example:</p>  <ul>  <li>a mechanism is provided to reveal the truncated text on the page (for instance, the text appears on focus or on activation)</li>  <li>where the ellipsis is part of a section of content which includes a link, the truncated text is revealed on the linked page</li>  </ul>  <p>Where text is not truncated but it is when text is spaced, if there is no mechanism to show the truncated text, it fails this Success Criterion.</p>  </section>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3 id=\"userresp\">User Responsibility</h3>  <p>The ability to read and derive meaning from the overridden spacing rests with the user. The user may choose to exceed the spacing adjustments in the SC. If the increased spacing causes loss of content or functionality, the user will adjust or return to the author’s original spacing or spacing within the bounds of the SC. Regardless, the user needs the flexibility to adjust spacing within the bounds set in the SC without loss of content or functionality. Such changes may be achieved via user stylesheet, bookmarklet, extension, or application.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3 id=\"effects-not-allowing\">Effects of Not Allowing for Spacing Override</h3>  <p>The following images show some types of failures when authors do not take into consideration that users may override spacing to the metrics specified in this Success Criterion.</p>  <section>  <h4 id=\"cutoff\">Text Cut Off</h4>  <p>The bottom portion of the words \"Your Needs\" is cut off in a heading making that text unreadable in Figure 1.

The 1st heading should read \"A cog in the wheel.\" But it reads \"A cog in the whe\". Only half of the second \"e\" is visible and the letter \"l\" is completely missing. The 2nd heading should read \"A penny for your thoughts\". But it reads \"A penny for your\". The 3rd should read \"Back to the drawing board.\" But it reads \"Back to the drawi\". </p>  <figure id=\"figure-horiz-text-cut\">  <figcaption>Horizontal text cut off is a failure.</figcaption>  <img src=\"img/spacing_cutoff_fail_horizontal.png\" alt=\"3 side-by-side headings with truncated text.\" width=\"509\" height=\"184\"/> </figure>  </section>  <section>  <h4 id=\"overlap\">Text Overlap</h4>  <p>In Figure 3 the last 3 words \"Groups and Programs\" of the heading \"Technologists Seeking Input from Groups and Programs\" overlap the following sentence.

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Additional content that appears and disappears in coordination with keyboard focus or pointer hover often leads to accessibility issues. Reasons for such issues include:</p><ol xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <li>the user may not have intended to trigger the interaction</li>  <li>the user may not know new content has appeared</li>  <li>the new content may intefere with a user's ability to do a task</li>  </ol><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Examples of such interactions can include custom tooltips, sub-menus and other nonmodal popups which display on hover and focus. The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that authors who cause additional content to appear and disappear in this manner must design the interaction in such a way that users can:</p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <li>perceive the additional content AND</li>  <li>dismiss it without disrupting their page experience.</li>  </ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">There are usually more predictable and accessible means of adding content to the page, which authors are recommended to employ. If an author <em>does</em> choose to make additional content appear and disappear in coordination with hover and keyboard focus, this success criterion specifies three conditions that must be met:</p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <li>dismissable</li>  <li>hoverable</li>  <li>persistent</li>  </ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Each of these is discussed in a separate section.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Dismissable</h3>  <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure that the additional content does not interfere with viewing or operating the page's original content. When magnified, the portion of the page visible in the viewport can be significantly reduced. Mouse users frequently move the pointer to pan the magnified viewport and display another portion of the screen. However, almost the entire portion of the page visible in this restricted viewport may trigger the additional content, making it difficult for a user to pan without re-triggering the content. A keyboard means of dismissing the additional content provides a workaround.</p>  <p>Alternatively, low vision users who can only navigate via the keyboard do not want the small area of their magnified viewport cluttered with hover text. They need a keyboard method of dismissing something that is obscuring the current focal area.</p>  <p>Two methods may be used to satisfy this condition and prevent such interference:</p>  <ol>  <li>Position the additional content so that it does not obscure any other content including the trigger, with the exception of white space and purely decorative content, such as a background graphic which provides no information.</li>  <li>Provide a mechanism to easily dismiss the additional content, such as by pressing Escape.</li>  </ol>  <p>For most triggers of relatively small size, it is desirable for both methods to be implemented. If the trigger is large, noticing the additional content may be of concern if it appears away from the trigger. In those cases, only the second method may be appropriate.</p>  <p>The success criterion allows for input error messages to persist as there are cases that require attention, explicit confirmation or remedial action.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Hoverable</h3>  <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure that additional content which may appear on hover of a target may also be hovered itself. Content which appears on hover can be difficult or impossible to perceive if a user is required to keep their mouse pointer over the trigger. When the added content is large, magnified views may mean that the user needs to scroll or pan to completely view it, which is impossible unless the user is able to move their pointer off the trigger without the additional content disappearing.</p>  <p>Another common situation is when large pointers have been selected via platform settings or assistive technology. Here, the pointer can obscure a significant area of the additional content. A technique to view the content fully in both situations is to move the mouse pointer directly from the trigger onto the new content. This capability also offers significant advantages for users who utilize screen reader feedback on mouse interactions. This condition generally implies that the additional content overlaps or is positioned adjacent to the target.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Persistent</h3>  <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure users have adequate time to perceive the additional content after it becomes visible. Users with disabilities may require more time for many reasons, such as to change magnification, move the pointer, or simply to bring the new content into their visual field. Once it appears, the content should remain visible until:</p>  <ul>  <li>The user removes hover or focus from the trigger and the additional content, consistent with the typical user experience;</li>  <li>The user dismisses the additional content via the mechanism provided to satisfy the Dismissable condition; or</li>  <li>The information conveyed by the additional content becomes invalid, such as a 'busy' message that is no longer valid.</li>  </ul>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Additional Notes</h3>  <ul>  <li>This criterion does not attempt to solve such issues when the appearance of the additional content is completely controlled by the user agent. A prominent example is the common behavior of browsers to display the <code>title</code>  attribute in HTML as a small tooltip.</li>  <li>Modal dialogs are out of scope for this criterion because they must take keyboard focus and thus should not appear on hover or focus. Refer to <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#on-focus\">Success Criterion 3.2.1, On Focus</a>.</li>  <li>Content which can be triggered via pointer hover should also be able to be triggered by keyboard focus. Refer to <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#keyboard\">Success Criterion 2.1.1, Keyboard</a>.</li>  </ul>  </section>",

When content can be operated through a keyboard or alternate keyboard,  it is operable by people with no vision (who cannot use devices such as mice that  require eye-hand coordination) as well as by people who must use alternate keyboards  or input devices that act as keyboard emulators. Keyboard emulators include speech  input software, sip-and-puff software, on-screen keyboards, scanning software and  a variety of assistive technologies and alternate keyboards. Individuals with low  vision also may have trouble tracking a pointer and find the use of software much  easier (or only possible) if they can control it from the keyboard.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Examples of \"specific timings for individual keystrokes\" include situations where  a user would be required to repeat or execute multiple keystrokes within a short period  of time or where a key must be held down for an extended period before the keystroke  is registered. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The phrase \"except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the  path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints\" is included to separate those  things that cannot reasonably be controlled from a keyboard.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Most actions carried out by a pointing device can also be done from the keyboard (for  example, clicking, selecting, moving, sizing). However, there is a small class of  input that is done with a pointing device that cannot be done from the keyboard in  any known fashion without requiring an inordinate number of keystrokes. Free hand  drawing, watercolor painting, and flying a helicopter through an obstacle course are  all examples of functions that require path dependent input. Drawing straight lines,  regular geometric shapes, re-sizing windows and dragging objects to a location (when  the path to that location is not relevant) do not require path dependent input.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The use of MouseKeys would not satisfy this Success Criterion because it is not a  keyboard equivalent to the application; it is a mouse equivalent (i.e., it looks like  a mouse to the application).  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">It is assumed that the design of user input features takes into account that operating  system keyboard accessibility features may be in use.

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Crition is to reduce accidental activation of keyboard shortcuts. Character key shortcuts work well for many keyboard users, but are inappropriate and frustrating for speech input users — whose means of input is strings of letters — and for keyboard users who are prone to accidentally hit keys. To rectify this issue, authors need to allow users to turn off or reconfigure shortcuts that are made up of only character keys. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Note that this success criterion doesn't affect components such as listboxes and drop-down menus. Although these components contain values (words) that may be selected by one or more character keys, the shortcuts are only active when the components have focus. Other components such as menus may be accessed or opened with a single non-character shortcut (e.g., Alt or Alt+F) before pressing a single character key to select an item. This makes the full path to invoking a menu a two-step shortcut that includes a non-printable key. <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/single-page.html#the-accesskey-attribute\">Accesskeys</a> are also not affected because they include modifier keys.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Speech Input users generally work in a single mode where they can use a mix of dictation and speech commands. This works well because the user knows to pause before and after commands, and commands are usually at least two words long. So, for instance, a user might say a bit of dictation, such as \"the small boat\", then pause, and say a command to delete that dictation, such as \"Delete Line\". In contrast, if the user were to say the two phrases together without a pause, the whole phrase would come out as dictation (i.e., \"the small boat delete line\"). Although speech input programs often include modes that listen only for dictation or only for commands, most speech users use the all-encompassing mode all the time because it is a much more efficient workflow. It could decrease command efficiency significantly if users were to change to command mode and back before and after issuing each command.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Speech users can also speak most keyboard commands (e.g., \"press Control Foxtrot\") without any problems. If the website or app is keyboard enabled, the speech user can also write a native speech macro that calls the keyboard command, such as \"This Print\" to carry out Ctrl+P.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Single-key shortcuts are the exception. While using single letter keys as controls might be appropriate and efficient for many keyboard users, single-key shortcuts are disastrous for speech users. The reason for this is that when only a single key is used to trip a command, a spoken word can become a barrage of single-key commands if the cursor focus happens to be in the wrong place.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For example, a speech-input user named Kim has her cursor focus in the main window of a web mail application that uses common keyboard shortcuts to navigate (\"k\"), archive (\"y\") and mute messages (\"m\"). A coworker named Mike enters her office and says \"Hey Kim\" and her microphone picks that up. The Y of \"hey\" archives the current message. K in \"Kim\" moves down one conversation and M mutes a message or thread. And, if Kim looks up and says \"Hey Mike\" without remembering to turn off the microphone, the same three things happen in a different sequence.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">A user interacting with a webpage or web app that doesn't use single-character shortcuts doesn't have this problem. Inadvertent strings of characters from the speech application are not interpreted as shortcuts if a modifier key is required. A speech user filling in a text input form may find that a phrase that is accidentally picked up by the speech microphone results in stray text being entered into the field, but that is easily seen and undone. The Resources section of this page contains links to videos demonstrating these types of issues.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"benefits\">  <h3>Benefits</h3>  <ul>  <li>Speech users will be able to turn off single-key shortcuts so they can avoid accidentally firing batches of them at once. This will allow speech users to make full use of programs that offer single-key shortcuts to keyboard users.</li>  <li>Keyboard-only users who have dexterity challenges can also be prone to accidentally hitting keys. Those users would be able to avoid problematic single character shortcuts by turning them off or modifying them to include at least one non-character key.</li>  <li>Allowing <em>all</em> shortcut keys to be remapped can help users with some cognitive disabilities, since the same shortcuts can be assigned to perform the same actions across different applications.</li>  </ul>  </section>",

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users with disabilities are  given adequate time to interact with Web content whenever possible. People with disabilities  such as blindness, low vision, dexterity impairments, and cognitive limitations may  require more time to read content or to perform functions such as filling out on-line  forms. If Web functions are time-dependent, it will be difficult for some users to  perform the required action before a time limit occurs. This may render the service  inaccessible to them. Designing functions that are not time-dependent will help people  with disabilities succeed at completing these functions. Providing options to disable  time limits, customize the length of time limits, or request more time before a time  limit occurs helps those users who require more time than expected to successfully  complete tasks. These options are listed in the order that will be most helpful for  the user. Disabling time limits is better than customizing the length of time limits,  which is better than requesting more time before a time limit occurs. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Any process that happens without user initiation after a set time or on a periodic  basis is a time limit. This includes partial or full updates of content (for example,  page refresh), changes to content, or the expiration of a window of opportunity for  a user to react to a request for input. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">It also includes content that is advancing or updating at a rate beyond the user's ability to read and/or understand it.

Examples of time limits for which this success criterion is not applicable include scrolling text that repeats, captioning, and <a href=\"http://https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/carousels/\">carousels</a>. These are situations which do include time limits, but the content is still available to the user because it has controls for accessing it, as specified in <a href=\"../../guidelines/sc/20/pause-stop-hide.html\">2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide</a>.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">In some cases, however, it is not possible to change the time limit (for example, for an auction or other real-time event) and exceptions are therefore provided for those cases.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <strong>Notes regarding server time limits</strong>  </p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <li>Timed server redirects can be found below under Common Failures.</li>  <li>Non-timed server redirects (e.g., 3xx response codes) are not applicable because there  is no time limit: they work instantly.  </li>  <li>This Success Criterion applies only to time limits that are set by the content itself.  For example, if a time limit is included in order to address security concerns, it  would be considered to have been set by the content because it is designed to be  part of the presentation and interaction experience for that content. Time limits  set externally to content, such as by the user agent or by factors intrinsic to the  Internet are not under the author's control and not subject to WCAG conformance requirements.  Time limits set by Web servers should be under the author's/organization's control  and are covered. (Success Criteria <a href=\"no-timing\" class=\"guideline\">2.2.3</a>, <a href=\"interruptions\" class=\"guideline\">2.2.4</a> and <a href=\"re-authenticating\" class=\"guideline\">2.2.5</a> may also apply.)  </li>  <li>Ten times the default was chosen based on clinical experience and other guidelines.  For example, if 15 seconds is allowed for a user to respond and hit a switch, 150  seconds would be sufficient to allow almost all users to hit a switch even if they  had trouble.  </li>  <li>20 seconds was also based on clinical experience and other guidelines. 20 seconds  to hit 'any switch' is sufficient for almost all users including those with spasticity.  Some would fail, but some would fail all lengths of time. A reasonable period for  requesting more time is required since an arbitrarily long time can provide security  risks to all users, including those with disabilities, for some applications. For  example, with kiosks or terminals that are used for financial transactions, it is  quite common for people to walk away without signing off. This leaves them vulnerable  to those walking up behind them. Providing a long period of inactivity before asking,  and then providing a long period for the person to indicate that they are present  can leave terminals open for abuse. If there is no activity the system should ask  if the user is there. It should then ask for an indication that a person is there  ('hit any key') and then wait long enough for almost anyone to respond. For \"hit any  key,\" 20 seconds would meet this. If the person indicates that they are still present,  the device should return the user to the exact condition that existed before it asked  the question.  </li>  <li>20 hours was chosen as an upper limit because it is longer than a full waking day.  </li>  </ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">In cases where timing is not an intrinsic requirement but giving users control over  timed events would invalidate the outcome, a third party can control the time limits  for the user (for example, granting double time on a test). </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">See also <a href=\"no-timing\">2.2.3: No Timing</a>.  </p>",

People  are even more sensitive to red flashing than to other colors, so a special test is  provided for saturated red flashing. These guidelines were originally based on guidelines for  the broadcasting industry as adapted for desktop monitors, where content is viewed  from a closer distance (using a larger angle of vision).  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Flashing can be caused by the display, the computer rendering the image or by the  content being rendered. The author has no control of the first two. They can be addressed  by the design and speed of the display and computer. The intent of this criterion  is to ensure that flicker that violates the flash thresholds is not caused by the  content itself. For example, the content could contain a video clip or animated image  of a series of strobe flashes, or close-ups of rapid-fire explosions.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This Success Criterion replaces a much more restrictive criterion in WCAG 1.0 that  did not allow any flashing (even of a single pixel) within a broad frequency range  (3 to 50 Hz). This Success Criterion is based on existing specifications in use in  the UK and by others for television broadcast and has been adapted for computer display  viewing. In WCAG 2.0, a 1024 x 768 screen was used as the reference screen resolution for the  evaluation. The 341 x 256 pixel block represents a 10 degree viewport at a typical  viewing distance. (The 10 degree field is taken from the original specifications and  represents the central vision portion of the eye, where people are most susceptible  to photo stimuli.)  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">With the proliferation of devices of varying screen sizes (from small hand-helds to large living room displays), as well as the adoption of <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-css-pixels\">CSS pixels</a> as a density-independent unit of measurement, the prior assessment criteria may seem outdated. However, an image of a consistent size uses up relatively the same percentage of a user's visual field on any device. On a large screen, the image takes up less size, but the large screen takes up a larger part of the visual field. On a mobile screen, the image may take up most or all of the screen; however, the mobile screen itself takes up a smaller portion of the user's visual field. So the same dimension of the flashing content, represented in CSS pixels can still provide a consistent means of assessment. Substituting CSS pixels for the original pixel block means that the combined area of flashing becomes 341 x 256 CSS pixels, or a flashing area of 87,296 CSS pixels.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Content should be analyzed at the largest scale at which a user may view the content, and at the standard zoom level of the user agent. For example, with a video that may play in an area of a web page and also at full screen, the video should be analyzed for risks at full screen.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Where video content is provided in color spaces other than sRGB, the version provided with the highest dynamic range should be tested. In such cases the industry standard definition of a general flash is a change in luminance of 20 cd/m2 or more where the darker image is below 160 cd/m2. (<a href=\"https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BT.1702/\">ITU-R BT.1702</a>.) This is applicable for standard dynamic range (SDR) and high dynamic range (HDR) content. For HDR content when the darker state is 160 cd/m2 or more, a general flash is one where the Michelson contrast is 1/17 or greater — where the Michelson contrast is calculated as (LHigh - LLow) / (LHigh + LLow), and where LHigh and LLow are the luminance of the high and low luminance states, respectively.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For short clips that might be looped (such as GIF animations), the content should be analyzed while looping. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">The specification cannot account for the actual viewing distance that a person chooses. Users that are closer to their screens than the idealized viewing distance will be affected by flashing areas that normatively pass. The same problem applies to users who rely on zoom or screen magnification. Conversely, users who are further away from the screen than the idealized distance should be able to tolerate flashing areas that are larger than the threshold.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The combined area of flashes occurring concurrently and contiguously means the total  area that is actually flashing at the same time. It is calculated by adding up the  contiguous area that is flashing simultaneously within any 10 degree angle of view.  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>The terms \"blinking\" and \"flashing\" can sometimes refer to the same content.</p>  <ul>  <li>\"Blinking\" refers to content that causes a distraction problem.

We are using different terms for the two because \"blinking\" causes  a distraction problem which you can allow for a short time as long as it stops (or  can be stopped) whereas \"flashing\" is a seizure trigger and cannot be allowed or it  will cause a seizure. The seizure would occur faster than most users could turn it  off. \"Blink\" therefore refers to slow repeating changes that would distract. \"Flash\"  refers to changes that could cause a seizure if they were bright enough or persisted  long enough. Blinking usually doesn't occur at speeds of 3 per second or more so blink  and flash do not overlap. However, blinking can occur faster than 3 per second so  there could be an overlap. See <a href=\"pause-stop-hide\">2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide</a> for more information on blink. </p>  </div>",

These tasks are often more difficult for people  with disabilities. For finding, navigation, and orientation, it is important that  the user can find out what the current location is. For navigation, information about  the possible destinations needs to be available. Screen readers convert content to  synthetic speech which, because it is audio, must be presented in linear order. Some Success Criteria in this guideline explain what provisions need to be taken to  ensure that screen reader users can successfully navigate the content.

Web pages  and applications often have content that appears on other pages or screens. Examples  of repeated blocks of content include but are not limited to navigation links, heading  graphics, and advertising frames. Small repeated sections such as individual words,  phrases or single links are not considered blocks for the purposes of this provision.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This is in contrast to a sighted user's ability to ignore the repeated material either  by focusing on the center of the screen (where main content usually appears) or a  mouse user's ability to select a link with a single mouse click rather than encountering  every link or form control that comes before the item they want.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">It is not the intent of this Success Criterion to require authors to provide methods  that are redundant to functionality provided by the user agent. Most web browsers  provide keyboard shortcuts to move the user focus to the top of the page, so if a  set of navigation links is provided at the bottom of a web page providing a \"skip\"  link may be unnecessary.  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>Although this Success Criterion deals with blocks of content that are repeated on  multiple pages, we also strongly promote structural markup on individual pages as  per Success Criteria 1.3.1.  </p>  </div><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Although the success criterion does not specifically use the term “within a set of  web pages”, the concept of the pages belonging to a set is implied. An author would  not be expected to avoid any possible duplication of content in any two pages that  are not in some way related to each other; that are not \"Web pages that share a common  purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization” (the definition  of set of web pages).  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>Even for web pages that are not in a set, if a web page has blocks of text that are  repeated within the page it may be helpful (but not required) to provide a means to  skip over them.  </p>  </div>",

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that when users navigate sequentially  through content, they encounter information in an order that is consistent with the  meaning of the content and can be operated from the keyboard. This reduces confusion  by letting users form a consistent mental model of the content. There may be different  orders that reflect logical relationships in the content. For example, moving through  components in a table one row at a time or one column at a time both reflect the logical  relationships in the content. Either order may satisfy this Success Criterion.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The way that sequential navigation order is determined in Web content is defined by  the technology of the content. For example, simple HTML defines sequential navigation  via the notion of tabbing order. Dynamic HTML may modify the navigation sequence using  scripting along with the addition of a tabindex attribute to allow focus to additional  elements. If no scripting or tabindex attributes are used, the navigation order is  the order that components appear in the content stream. (See HTML 4.01 Specification,  section 17.11, \"Giving focus to an element\").  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">An example of keyboard navigation that is not the sequential navigation addressed  by this Success Criterion is using arrow key navigation to traverse a tree component.  The user can use the up and down arrow keys to move from tree node to tree node. Pressing  the right arrow key may expand a node, then using the down arrow key, will move into  the newly expanded nodes. This navigation sequence follows the expected sequence for  a tree control - as additional items get expanded or collapsed, they are added or  removed from the navigation sequence.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The focus order may not be identical to the programmatically determined reading order  (see Success Criterion 1.3.2) as long as the user can still understand and operate  the Web page. Since there may be several possible logical reading orders for the content,  the focus order may match any of them. However, when the order of a particular presentation  differs from the programmatically determined reading order, users of one of these  presentations may find it difficult to understand or operate the Web page. Authors  should carefully consider all these users as they design their Web pages.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For example, a screen reader user interacts with the programmatically determined reading  order, while a sighted keyboard user interacts with the visual presentation of the  Web page. Care should be taken so that the focus order makes sense to both of these  sets of users and does not appear to either of them to jump around randomly. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For clarity:</p><ol xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <li>Focusable components need to receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and  operability only when navigation sequences affect meaning and operability.  </li>  <li>In those cases where it is required, there may be more than one order that will preserve  meaning and operability.  </li>  <li>If there is more than one order that preserves meaning and operability, only one of  them needs to be provided.  </li>  </ol>",

Assistive technology has the ability to provide users with a list of links that are  on the Web page. Link text that is as meaningful as possible will aid users who want  to choose from this list of links. Meaningful link text also helps those who wish  to tab from link to link. Meaningful links help users choose which links to follow  without requiring complicated strategies to understand the page.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The text of, or associated with, the link is intended to describe the purpose of the  link. In cases where the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name  of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of  the link (which is to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is  not required to use the name of the document or web application; other things may  also describe the purpose of the link. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <a href=\"page-titled\" class=\"understanding\">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> deals with the titles of pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application  being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page.  Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides  continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">In some situations, authors may want to provide part of the description of the link  in logically related text that provides the context for the link. In this case the  user should be able to identify the purpose of the link without moving focus from  the link. In other words, they can arrive on a link and find out more about it without  losing their place. This can be achieved by putting the description of the link in  the same sentence, paragraph, list item, or table cell as the link, or in the table header cell for a link in a data table, because these are directly associated with the link itself. Alternatively, authors may choose to use an ARIA technique to associate additional  text on the page with the link.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This context will be most usable if it precedes the link. (For instance, if you must  use ambiguous link text, it is better to put it at the end of the sentence that describes  its destination, rather than putting the ambiguous phrase at the beginning of the  sentence.) If the description follows the link, there can be confusion and difficulty  for screen reader users who are reading through the page in order (top to bottom).  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">It is a best practice for links with the same destination to have consistent text  (and this is a requirement per <a href=\"consistent-identification\" class=\"guideline\">Success Criterion 3.2.4</a> for pages in a set). It is also a best practice for links with different purposes  and destinations to have different link text.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">A best practice for links to <a>conforming alternate versions</a> is to ensure that the link text to the conforming alternate version indicates in link text that the page it leads to represents the more accessible version. This information may also be provided in text - the goal is to ensure that the end user knows what the purpose of the link is. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the  link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation,  the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context  available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available  on the Web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made  available in the link text or programmatically associated with the link to satisfy  the Success Criterion.  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>There may be situations where the purpose of the link is is supposed to be unknown  or obscured. For instance, a game may have links identified only as door #1, door  #2, and door #3.

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand the purpose of each  link in the content, so they can decide whether they want to follow it. Best practice  is that links with the same destination would have the same descriptions, but links  with different purposes and destinations would have different descriptions (see also  <a href=\"consistent-identification\" class=\"guideline\">Success Criterion 3.2.4</a> which calls for consistency in identifying components that have the same functionality).  Because the purpose of a link can be identified from its link text, links can be understood  when they are out of context, such as when the user agent provides a list of all the  links on a page.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The text in the link is intended to describe the purpose of the link. In cases where  the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name of the document or  web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the link (which is  to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is not required to use  the name of the document or web application; other things may also describe the purpose  of the link. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <a href=\"page-titled\" class=\"understanding\">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> deals with the titles of pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application  being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page.  Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides  continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the  link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation,  the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context  available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available  on the Web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made  available in the link text to satisfy the Success Criterion.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The word \"mechanism\" is used to allow authors to either make all links fully understandable  out of context by default or to provide a way to make them this way. This is done  because for some pages, making the links all unambiguous by themselves makes the pages  easier for some users and harder for others. Providing the ability to make the links  unambiguous (by them selves) or not provides both users with disabilities with the  ability to use the page in the format that best meets their needs.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For example: A page listing 100 book titles along with links to download the books  in HTML, PDF, DOC, TXT, MP3, or AAC might ordinarily be viewed as the title of the  book as a link with the words \"in HTML\" after it. then the sentence \"Also available  in: \" followed by a series of short links with text of \"HTML\", \"PDF\", \"DOC\", \"TXT\",  \"MP3\", and \"AAC\". At Level 3, some users could opt to view the page this way - because  they would find the page harder to understand or slower to use if the full title of  the book were included in each of the links. Others could opt to view the page with  the full title as part of each of the links so that each link was understandable in  itself. Both the former and the latter groups could include people with visual or  cognitive disabilities that used different techniques to browse or that had different  types or severities of disability.  </p>",

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that the item receiving keyboard focus is always partially visible in the user's viewport. For sighted people who rely on a keyboard (or on a device that operates through the keyboard interface, such as a switch or voice input), knowing the current point of focus is critical. The component with focus signals the interaction point on the page. Where users cannot see the item with focus, they may not know how to proceed, or may even think the system has become unresponsive.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">In recognition of the complex responsive designs common today, this AA criterion allows for the component receiving focus to be <em>partially</em> obscured by other author-created content. A partly obscured component can still be very visible, although the more of it that is obscured, the less easy it is to see.

Focus Visible requires that a visible focus indicator exists while a component has keyboard focus; this SC defines a minimum level of visibility. Where Non-text Contrast requires a component to have adequate contrast against the background in each of its states, this SC requires sufficient contrast for the focus indicator itself.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For sighted people with mobility impairments who use a keyboard or a device that utilizes the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-keyboard-interface\">keyboard interface</a> (such as a switch or voice input), knowing the current point of focus is very important. Visible focus must also meet the needs of users with low vision, who may also rely on the keyboard.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">A keyboard focus indicator can take different forms. This Success Criterion lists two ways to achieve a sufficient focus appearance. The first involves three primary considerations for the entire focus indicator. A second way of achieving sufficient focus appearance is by meeting similar considerations for an area of the focus indicator. This Understanding document will elaborate on each of the three primary considerations, then address the area considerations, and finally list some user agent exceptions.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"encloses\">   <h3>Encloses</h3>  <p>The first of the focus indicator bullets states that the focus indicator \"encloses\" the user interface component. This is defined to mean \"solidly bounds or surrounds.\" Both <em>bounds</em> and <em>surrounds</em> describe optimal and established ways of showing focus. <em>Bounds</em> and its related term \"bounding box\" generally describe a rectangle drawn around the outside of a user interface component. It is the most common form of focus indication and is sometimes referred to as a \"focus rectangle.\"</p>   <figure id=\"focus-indicator-basic\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-basic.png\" alt=\"2 blue buttons with a dark 1 pixel thick offset focus rectangle around the second\"/>  <figcaption>Passes: A solid focus rectangle around the second of two buttons.</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>\"Surrounds\" also refers to something that solidly encloses a shape. However, a shape can be surrounded in many ways, not just by a rectangle. For instance, the focus indicator may follow the outline of the object being enclosed. The difference between <em>bounds</em> and <em>surrounds</em> is illustrated in the following two images of a set of ratings stars. In both examples, the same three stars have already been selected, and focus is on the third star. The first has a rectangular bounding box. The second matches the star shape of the object itself. </p>  <figure id=\"focus-border-solid\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-solid-border.svg\" alt=\"3 of 5 stars are selected with a solid-line rectangular focus indicator around the third\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: a solidly bound focus rectangle encloses the third of five stars.</figcaption>  </figure>   <figure id=\"focus-outline-solid\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-solid-outline.svg\" alt=\"Three of 5 stars are selected with a solid-line focus indicator in the shape of a star outlining the third\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: a solid outline indicator surrounds the third of five stars.</figcaption>  </figure> <h4>Solidly</h4>  <p>Where the indicator does not \"solidly\" bound or surround the component, as with a dashed or dotted line, it cannot meet this primary consideration. However, a non-solid line can still pass if it meets the area calculations for the size of the focus indicator (discussed in more detail under Area of focus indicator).</p>   <figure id=\"focus-indicator-weak-dashed\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-weak-dashed-border.svg\" alt=\"3 of 5 stars are selected with the whole third star outlined with a 1 pixel thick dashed line\"/>  <figcaption> Fails: the dashed outline does not \"solidly bound\" the third star and does not meet the size requirements of the focus area calculation.</figcaption>  </figure> <figure id=\"focus-indicator-strong-dashed\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-strong-dashed-border.svg\" alt=\"3 of 5 stars are selected with the whole third star outlined with a 2 pixel thick dashed line\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: the dashed outline does not \"solidly bound\" the third star; however, the dashed line meets the size requirements of the focus area calculation.</figcaption>  </figure> </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"contrast-pixels\">   <h3>Indicator contrasts between its focused and unfocused states</h3>   <p>The second of the focus indicator bullets states that the indicator \"has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between its pixels in the focused and unfocused states.\" The following illustration shows a <strong>minimally</strong> contrasting focus indicator, where some of the white pixels making up the page background have been altered to a mid-grey, which contrast 3:1 with the original white. Authors are encouraged to exceed the minimum focus appearance. For instance, the dark blue lines in the first two illustrations are much more visible.</p>   <figure id=\"focus-indicator-star-with-light-focus\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-star-with-light-focus.svg\" alt=\"Two orange-yellow five-pointed stars, one with a mid-gray focus rectangle\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: Two buttons in the shape of a star, with the second surrounded by a focus indicator whose pixels contrast 3:1 between focused (light grey) and unfocused (white) states.</figcaption>  </figure> </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"contrast-adjacent\">  <h3>Contrasts at least 3:1 against adjacent colors</h3>   <p>The third of the focus indicator bullets states that the focus indicator must contrast against the pixels on either side. Where the indicator is offset from the shape and does not directly abut the component or any other object -- as in all preceding examples -- it simply needs to contrast at least 3:1 against the page background. Offsetting is the recommended way of creating a more visible focus indicator. However, where authors choose to position the indicator so it is directly next to or overlaps another shape, it must contrast 3:1 against this adjacent shape as well.</p>   <figure id=\"focus-indicator-abutted\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-star-with-abutted-line.svg\" alt=\"Two orange-yellow five-pointed stars, the second with a tightly cropped blue focus outline\"/>  <figcaption>Passes: The second of two stars has a star-shaped blue outline that directly abuts the star, with which it contrasts 3:1, creating a minimally visible focus indicator.</figcaption>  </figure> </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"keyboard-focus\">  <h3>Component keyboard focus</h3>  <p>The preamble to this SC is \"When a user interface component has keyboard focus...\" The <em>keyboard focus</em> is the point of interaction for someone using a keyboard. For environments with a keyboard-operable interface, the keyboard focus can be moved around the interface in order to interact with different components. Whichever component is being interacted with has focus.</p>   <p>WCAG defines <em>user interface component</em> as \"a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function.\" Because different users may perceive controls differently, there is a potential for some variation when interpreting what constitutes both a <em>single control</em> and a <em>distinct function</em>. This is particularly the case when something visually presents in a way that may differ from how it is programmatically created under the covers. Where there is not a native HTML component upon which to base designs, there can be great variations in how the components and their focus indicators are portrayed. Further, some components have sub-components that can take focus, such as the menu items on a menu.</p>  <p> Nonetheless, consistent results from different testers were obtained for this SC by using the focus indicator itself as the gauge of what constitutes the component being interacted with. For complex components, the three typical focus indicators are as follows:</p>   <ul>  <li>Focus indicator around only the whole component</li>  <li>Focus indicators around both the component and subcomponent</li>  <li>Focus indicator around only the subcomponent</li>  </ul>  <p>Each of these will be discussed, using a tablist as a familiar complex component.</p>  <h4>Focus indicator around only the whole component</h4>  <figure id=\"component-complex-whole\">  <img src=\"img/component-complex-whole.png\" alt=\"Three tab buttons shown with a dark blue rectangle around all three tab buttons.\"/>  <figcaption> A tablist with a focus indicator around only the whole.</figcaption>  </figure> <p>When the focus indicator is shown only around the whole tablist, the user is guided to considering the tablist as a single user component. The tab items within it are visually distinguished between selected and unselected states (and visual indicators of selection state must meet the criteria given in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html\">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a>).</p>  <p>Having a focus indicator <em>only</em> around the whole is possible where there is no need to have a selected sub-component while another sub-component has focus. For a tablist which synchronizes its tab panel content with whatever tab is active, only one tab item can be selected at a time, and since whatever tab is selected is considered active, a separate focus indicator is redundant.</p>  <p>Result: the group focus indicator must meet the requirements of this SC.</p>  <p>A <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/practical-cori-nl4pld?file=/index.html\">radio button group</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/slider/slider-rating.html\">star-rating widget</a>, which each use only a whole-component focus indicator, provide working examples of different complex components that pass the primary requirements of this SC. In the star ratings example, users can increment the rating by 1/2 stars. Not only is a focus indicator for each 1/2 star unnecessary, but it would actually be difficult to achieve without making the interaction confusing.</p>   <h4>Focus indicators around both the component and subcomponent</h4>  <figure id=\"component-complex-both\">  <img src=\"img/component-complex-both.png\" alt=\"Three tab buttons shown with a dark blue rectangle around all three tab buttons, the first tab button also has a dark outline as well as a blue bar indicating it is selected.\"/>  <br/>  <img src=\"img/component-complex-both-unselected.png\" alt=\"The same tab list showing except the first tab is selected, but the second has the focus outline.\"/>  <figcaption> The same tablist in two states. In the first, focus is around both the tablist and the currently selected tab; in the second, focus is around both the tablist and an unselected tab.</figcaption>  </figure> <p>For a tablist which does not keep its tab panel content synchronized with whatever tab is selected, there needs to be a focus indicator for the tab item subcomponent. This is because the tab item with focus may be different than the selected item.</p>  <p>The user can navigate to the tablist, which in this implementation has a focus rectangle around the whole tablist as well as one around a tab item (conventionally the item that is currently selected). The focus around the whole is helpful in cueing a keyboard user that this is a complex component that has its own interaction. The user can then move focus between the unselected and selected tab items -- each of which in turn has its own focus indicator -- before activating one, which then makes it selected as well as focused, and updates the tab panel to match.</p>  <p>In this scenario, either the group focus indicator or the sub-component indicator must meet the requirements of this Success Criterion. To avoid being overly prescriptive, the Success Criterion allows authors to choose which makes the most sense. Generally, if a sub-component focus is necessary, it should be assessed instead of the group indicator.</p>  <p>Result: the focus indicator for the tab item meets the requirements of this SC. The tablist focus indicator does not need to meet the requirements.</p>   <p>A <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/slider/slider-color-viewer.html\">slider to pick colors</a> provides a working example of a different complex component that predominantly shows focus for the subcomponent. In this case, the thumb slider sub-component has a focus indicator of sufficient size and contrast to pass the sufficient area calculation. There is also a subtle focus around the whole slider component, but it does not need to be assessed to pass this SC.</p>  <h4>Focus indicator around only the subcomponent</h4>  <figure id=\"component-complex-sub\">  <img src=\"img/component-complex-sub.png\" alt=\"Three tab buttons shown and the first button has a dark outline.\"/>  <figcaption> The same tabs as in the prior set, but the focus indicator around the whole is removed.</figcaption>  </figure> <p>The same unsynchronized tablist can also be implemented as something which only shows focus on the tab items and not on the whole. The behaviour is the same as in the prior example, but there is never a focus indicator placed around the tablist. This interaction is acceptable, but it is not best practice since it demands more understanding from the user with less information. For example, some visual cues for the tablist and tab items (and tab panel) may not be clear. As well, keyboard users may not initially understand the expected keyboard interaction.</p>  <p>Result: the focus indicator for the tab item must meet the requirements of this SC, judging focus with both selected and unselected tab items.</p>   <p>A <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tab_role#example\"> functional example of sub-component-only tab focus</a> has an indicator that is large enough (at least four times the shortest side) with sufficient contrast to pass the focus area language of this SC.</p>  <h4>Where something with focus is not a user interface component</h4>  <p>Some pages contain very large editing regions, such as web implementations of word processors and code editors. Unlike a <code>textarea</code> element, which is a user interface component, these large editing regions do not typically meet the definition of <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/wcag/guidelines/22/#dfn-user-interface-components\">user interface components</a>; they are not \"perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function.\" Providing focus indicators around such editing regions may still be beneficial to some; however, where the region is not perceived as a single control, it is not covered by this Success Criterion. The web page will still need to provide a insertion point (caret indicator) in such editing regions in order to meet the requirements of <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible.html\">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a>.</p>   <p>Some non-operable elements can take focus (such as a heading element that is the target of a skip link). However, the preamble of this SC refers to user interface components; it is only when the element with focus is operable by keyboard that this Success Criterion applies.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"area\">  <h3>Area of focus indicator</h3>  <p>In addition to achieving a minimum keyboard focus appearance using the three primary means described above to assess the entire focus indicator, an author can also meet this SC's requirements by assessing an area of the focus indicator for sufficient size and contrast.</p>   <section id=\"size-of-indicator\">  <h4>Minimum area</h4>  <blockquote>  <ul>  <li>is at least as large as the area of a 1 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component, or is at least as large as a 4 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side of a minimum bounding box of the unfocused component</li>  </ul>  </blockquote>  <p>The first of these bullets defines a minimum area for the focus indicator using a calculation for perimeter, and a secondary minimum based on the shortest side of the control. It does not restrict where the indicators are placed, it is just providing two methods to calculate a minimum area.</p>  <p>For the first calculation, the minimum area of the focus indicator must be at least as large as the area of a 1 CSS pixel thick perimeter (border) of the control in its unfocused state. The indicator does not have to be a border, but the indicator's area must be at least as large. For example, if a control is a rectangle of 90px wide and 30px tall, the size of the outer border is 90 + 90 + 30 + 30 = 240 CSS pixels. You then must subtract the 4 corner pixels (which are counted twice, both horizontally and vertically), for a total minimum area of 236 CSS pixels.</p>  <p class=\"note\">A <a>CSS pixel</a> is what developers use in CSS declarations like “width: 200px”. It is device-independent and not to be confused with device pixels which vary depending on the physical pixel density. <br/>  The rest of this document notates CSS pixels as \"px\".  </p>  <p>The following 3 examples use a 90px wide by 30px tall button, therefore the surface area requirement is 236px (240px minus corner 4 pixels). The middle button is focused in each example.</p>  <figure id=\"focus-indicator-innerline\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-innerline.png\" alt=\"Three dark blue buttons on a white background. The middle button has a yellow inner border.\" width=\"284\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: the inner outline is slightly smaller than the outer edge of the component (236px minus 2px on each side), but using a 2px thick indicator means it is well over the minimum requirement of 236px squared.</figcaption>  </figure>  <figure id=\"focus-indicator-underline\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-underline.png\" alt=\"Three dark blue buttons on a white background. The middle button has a thick yellow line under the text.\" width=\"284\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: the thick (3px) yellow underline, at 80px almost as long as the longest edge, multiplied by 3px exceeds the requirement of 236px squared.</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>If controls change size across different variations of a page (e.g., in a responsive design), it helps to use a proportionally sized indicator such as an outline or background change. In that way you can be sure of meeting the size requirement.</p>   <p>Another way of achieving the area requirement is to alter the appearance of the entire component, for instance by changing its color. This can be effective in a set of closely placed buttons. The following example using the same set of 5 ratings stars given in the first illustrations in this document, shows how this can be achieved. However, it is much more difficult to detect such a focus indicator when components are not near each other and so cannot be easily compared. For users using magnification, even components relatively close together may be difficult to compare, so it is not considered a best practice. </p>  <figure id=\"focus-indicator-whole\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-whole-star.svg\" alt=\"3 of 5 stars are selected with the whole third star altered in color to indicate focus\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: a color change applies to the whole third star to indicate focus.</figcaption>  </figure> <p>The Success Criterion includes an alternative size measure of \"at least as large as a 4 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side\". This is included to allow for smaller but thick indicators. For example, some controls might be of a fixed height but variable width, in which case this measure, 4×<em>h</em>, allows for a more consistent approach. A button that is 40 CSS pixels high would need to have a focus area of at least 160 CSS pixels (40×4).</p>  <figure id=\"focus-indicator-shortside\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-thick-short-side.png\" alt=\"Two dark blue buttons on a white background. The left button has a very thick yellow block of color left of the text.\" width=\"284\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: the yellow block on the left is along the short side, but very thick.</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>Typical focus indicators:</p>  <ul>  <li>A solid outline around the whole component would pass the size requirement;</li>  <li>A 1 CSS pixel dotted outline around the whole component would <strong>not pass</strong> the size requirement, as it is roughly 50% of the surface area of a solid line.</li>  <li>Changing the background within a control would pass the size requirement;</li>  <li>A 1px wide vertical line (such as a blinking cursor) would <strong>not pass</strong> the size requirement; a text input would need a larger or separate focus indicator.</li>  </ul>  <p>The bigger the visible change when an item receives focus, the easier it is for someone to see. Authors are encouraged to make the change as significant as possible, for example by designing a thick border around the element. If you need to use complex mathematics to work out if a focus indicator is large enough, it is probably a sign that you should use a larger and proportional indicator that will provide a more visible indicator.</p>   <h5>Unusual shapes</h5>  <p>If you have an unusual shape (not rectangular), some mathematics may be required if the focus indicator is on the edge of the size requirement. For example, if the focusable control is a circle with a diameter of 100px, the circumference would be 314 pixels. A 1px (or greater) outline would meet the size criterion.</p>   <figure id=\"focus-indicator-circle\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-circle.png\" alt=\"Two orange circular buttons with an icon in the middle. The right hand circle has a dark outline around the whole circle to indicate focus\" width=\"150\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: a circular button in the default state, and then with a focus indicator.</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>If a focus indicator is an irregular shape, such as a drop shadow under a star icon, it helps if the contrasting area is quite large.</p>   <figure id=\"focus-indicator-star-shadow\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-star-shadow.png\" alt=\"Two yellow star symbols, the second has a dark drop-shadow.\" width=\"400\"/>  <figcaption> An unfocused star component beside one using a drop shadow to show focus.</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>What is the contrasting area of the drop shadow? The quick method is:</p>  <ul>  <li>Look at the size of the component, how long is it around the edges?</li>  <li>Look at the (contrasting) area of the focus indicator.</li>  <li>Mentally compare the focus indicator to the border of the component.</li>  </ul>   <p>If it is too close to call, you could extract the contrasting area of the focus indicator and evaluate the surface area.</p>  <h5>Gradients</h5>  <p>If a focus indicator has a gradient, the principle is to measure the contrast of the changed area, and ignore the change that does not meet 3:1.</p>  <figure id=\"focus-indicator-box-shadow\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-box-shadow.png\" alt=\"Three buttons, the middle with a heavy drop-shadow indicating focus.\"/>  <figcaption> When a gradient is used on a focus indicator, the measure of surface area should only include the area that has changed enough to meet the 3:1 contrast ratio.</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>If you take some spot-checks on the gradient area and establish what area meets the contrast, it is straightforward to work out if that area is sufficient.</p>  <figure id=\"focus-indicator-box-shadow-only\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-box-shadow-only.png\" alt=\"The middle button with the drop-shadow included, but the subtle grey areas removed to only show the contrasting area.\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: the same focused button with the non-contrasting areas removed, showing that it is a thick indicator that meets the requirements.</figcaption>  </figure>  <p class=\"note\">Some of the examples in this document are screen-captured images of elements. Due to loss of resolution in these images, the actual pixel color may not match the original. As such, they are intended to be used for illustrative purposes, and should not be inspected on a pixel-by-pixel basis for sufficient contrast.</p> <p>Some designs have pages with a non-solid background image covering the whole (or part) of the page or make use of parallax scrolling effects which result in a near-infinite number of color combinations if a page is scrolled and/or changes are made to the viewport size.</p>  <p>If the contrast of background colors that change are close enough to need to be tested for each combination then they would likely not meet the user need of people with low vision in certain scroll combinations and would likely fail in certain combinations as well. In these cases it would be an easy solution to use a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/css/C40\">double ring focus indicator</a> or some other mechanism to indicate focus such as a solid box with a border to guarantee there is sufficient contrast across variations of background images or background gradients.</p>  <h5>Inline links</h5>  <p>If an inline link is broken over multiple lines, some methods of creating a focus indicator create different results by browsers. CSS <code>outline</code> separately surrounds each part of a link that breaks across multiple lines. It is by far the most common CSS technique for focus indication, and produces a result that satisfies the minimum bounding box definition since each part is solidly bound. CSS <code>border</code> will split the perimeter across the parts of the link, which results in an unenclosed border for each line of the link. The minimum bounding box definition states that link focus can be assessed as if the link was all on one line, so these are also considered to meet the \"encloses\" language. Therefore, where the contrast requirements are met, each of these methods produces a sufficient focus indicator.</p>  <figure id=\"focus-indicator-inline-link-outline\">  <img src=\"img/focus-inline-link-outline.png\" alt=\"A paragraph of text containing a link broken over two lines. The red focus indicator is a complete rectangle around each part of the link.\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: the CSS <code>outline</code> property solidly bounds each part of the link completely, so meets the \"encloses\" requirement for indicator area.</figcaption>  </figure>   <figure id=\"focus-indicator-inline-link\">  <img src=\"img/focus-inline-link.png\" alt=\"A paragraph of text containing a link broken over two lines. The red focus indicator has a gap on the right of one part of the link, and on the left of the other part of the link.\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: Although the CSS <code>border</code> on a multi-line link does not enclose the link, the minimum bounding box definition allows it to be assessed as if it was on a single line. As well, the indicator's area is invariably more than four times the shortest-side calculation .</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>If authors rely on the text-decoration property of links as a focus indicator (for example, no text underline by default, then showing a 1px underline when focused), that is likely to meet the minimum size requirement only if the text is more than 9 characters. If the number of characters in the links vary, it is likely some links will fail.</p>   <p>For example, a 16px tall text link would need a width of four times the <strong>shortest</strong> side (4 × 16 = 64px). With default browser styles, a 10-character word (for example, \"accessible\") is usually over 70px wide, and would therefore pass. However, this is not a focus indicator that would <em>reliably</em> pass this criterion. It would be more visible to retain the browser's default indicator or use a complete perimeter indicator, either of which would pass. The lack of indicator for a link is also likely to fail <a href=\"use-of-color\">1.4.1 Use of Color</a>.</p>    </section>   <section id=\"change-of-contrast\">  <h4>Change of contrast</h4>   <blockquote>  <ul>  <li>has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against the same pixels in the unfocused state</li>  </ul>  </blockquote>   <p>The second of the Area bullets matches the second of the primary considerations about a visual difference between a component with and without focus. The greater the change of contrast between states, the easier it is for users to see it. Authors are encouraged to make the change of color contrast as great as possible.</p>   <p>When a component changes to include a focus indicator, that change can be measured as a change of color contrast. For example, if a yellow outline is added to a button on a blue background, the change of color is from blue to yellow.

This is not considered a visible indicator.</p>  </section>  <section id=\"contrast-thickness\">  <h3>Adjacent non-focus-indicator contrast</h3>   <blockquote>  <ul>  <li>Has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent non-focus-indicator colors, or is no thinner than 2 CSS pixels.</li>  </ul>  </blockquote>   <p>The third of these Area bullets is similar to the third primary consideration -- the focus indicator must contrast with whatever it is next to <strong>or</strong> it must be thick enough that it is easier to see. Where a control is a solid color, and you add a border or outline of a very similar color, it is difficult to perceive the change to the control.</p>   <figure id=\"focus-indicator-thin-non-contrast\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-thin-non-contrast.png\" alt=\"Three dark buttons, the middle one appears very slightly larger due to a thin dark outline.\" width=\"255\"/>  <figcaption> Fails: adding a 1px dark outline around a dark button does not differentiate it. This example <strong>fails</strong> the Success Criterion.</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>The requirement is to have an indicator that has a 3:1 contrast ratio with the adjacent colors of the component, or to be separated from the component, or to be at least 2px thick.</p>   <figure id=\"focus-indicator-thick-non-contrast\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-thick-non-contrast.png\" alt=\"Three dark buttons, the middle one appears larger due to a thick dark outline.\" width=\"255\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: adding a 2px border around the button helps to differentiate which one is focused.</figcaption>  </figure>   <figure id=\"focus-indicator-outerline\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-outerline.png\" alt=\"Three dark buttons, the middle one has a outline slightly offset away from the component, so there is a gap between the component's background and the outline.\" width=\"250\"/>  <figcaption> Adding an outline that is separated from the button helps to differentiate which one is focused.</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>If the focus indicator uses several colors, any color which does not contrast 3:1 against adjacent colors can be ignored as long as there is a 2 CSS pixel-thick part of the focus indicator whose pixels all change at least 3:1 between their focused and non-focused states. Practically, this means 3D drop-shadows and other stylings on a focus indicator can likely be ignored when assessing focus appearance.</p>   <figure id=\"focus-indicator-extra-outline\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-extra-outline.png\" alt=\"Two dark blue buttons on a white background. The second one has a dark outline, then a light grey outline on the outside.\" width=\"250\"/>  <figcaption> Passes: the 3px thick dark outline also meets the size and change of contrast requirements. The light grey outline can be ignored.</figcaption>  </figure>  <p>Where a focus indicator is defined in code as a certain size (e.g. 2px thickness) or color, anti-aliasing can be ignored for the purposes of calculation. Dotted or dashed outlines have various levels of gaps depending on the browser, screen density, and thickness. For example, in most browsers a \"dotted\" line will have roughly half the number of pixels due to gaps. However, in some sizes or browsers it might be slightly less than half, so increasing the thickness may be required.</p>  </section>   <section id=\"relation-non-text-color-contrast\">  <h3>Relationship to Non-text Contrast</h3>  <p>In combination with <a href=\"focus-visible\">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a>, <a href=\"non-text-contrast\" class=\"sc\">1.4.11 Non-text Contrast</a> requires that the visual focus indicator for a component must have sufficient contrast against the adjacent colors when the component is focused, except where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author.</p>  <p>However, Non-text Contrast differs in what it assesses. Unlike the current Success Criterion, it does not require that the focus indicator has a change of contrast <em>between</em> the focused and non-focused states. Additionally, there is no size requirement and no exception for user agent default indicators.</p>  <figure id=\"focus-indicator-ntc-comparison1\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-ntc-comparison1.png\" alt=\"Three dark blue buttons, the center button also has a thin dark line around it.\" width=\"400\"/>  <figcaption> A 1px dark outline around a dark button would pass 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast, but fails this Success Criterion.</figcaption>   </figure>   </section>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"exceptions\">  <h3>Exceptions</h3>  <p>There are two situations where the focus appearance does not need to be assessed:</p>  <ul>  <li>the focus indicator cannot be adjusted by the author</li>  <li>the author has not modified the effects of the user agent default</li>  </ul>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"cannot-adjust\">  <h3>First exception: the focus indicator cannot be adjusted by the author</h3>   <blockquote><p>The focus indicator is determined by the user agent and cannot be adjusted by the author</p></blockquote>  <p>Some components or technologies may not allow the author to adjust the focus indicator. This is the case with HTML <code>select</code> elements (both single and multi-select), where the visual treatments for selection and focus cannot be adjusted by the author. In this case the Success Criterion does not apply.</p>  <figure id=\"country-select\">  <img src=\"img/focus-indicator-select.png\" alt=\"A country select element with Afghanistan selected and Albani with focus\"/>  <figcaption>Passes: The user agent's default <code>select</code> element presentation cannot be modified by the author, so it passes regardless of the quality of the focus indicator</figcaption>  </figure> </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"default\">  <h3>Second exception: the default indicator and background are not modified</h3>  <blockquote><p>The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author</p></blockquote>  <p>If the focus indicator and the background behind the focus indicator are not modified by the author, the Success Criterion does not apply.</p>  <p>The intent of this exception is to reduce burden on authors by allowing them to rely on the default indicators provided by user agents (browsers). If all user agents provided good focus indicators, authors would be able to concentrate efforts on other accessibility considerations. Unfortunately, browser default focus indicators vary by component, browser, and across devices and operating systems, and the default focus indicators in some browsers can be difficult to see (such as a 1px dotted outline). For this reason, most authors override browser defaults in order to overcome these deficiencies and create a more uniform user experience, regardless of browser.</p>  <p>Some browser makers are improving their default focus indicators to make them more visible. As more browsers adopt defaults that meet the primary bullets of this SC, authors will be able to achieve improved focus indicators without customization.</p>   <h4>Modifying the focus indicator background</h4>  <p>Browser default focus indicators can be made <em>more</em> difficult to see if the author modifies the pixels directly adjacent to the indicator (commonly referred to as its background), such as by positioning a component on top of an image or gradient background, or altering the page's default white background color, for instance using a blue background in combination with a browser's blue default indicator. For this reason, where the author alters the pixels directly adjacent to the default focus indicator, the user agent exception does not apply, and the author will need to verify they meet the size and contrast requirements of this Success Criterion.</p>  <p style=\"note\">Altering the <code>body</code> element's <code>background-color</code> attribute <em>is</em> one way of altering the pixels directly adjacent to the indicator in most implementations. However, specifying a value of white (<code>#FFFFFF</code>) does not nullify this exception since, as established in the third note of the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-contrast-ratio\">contrast ratio definition</a>, the default (\"unspecified\") color is assumed to be white.</p>  <p>[Future image set: a button with a default light blue focus indicator on a white page; the same button and focus indicator on a light blue page background]</p>   <p>As well, if the browser provides an indicator <em>within</em> a component by default, then authors can potentially reduce the visibility by changing the component color (which in such a scenario is the background color for the focus indicator). For example, if the default indicator on a button is a bright yellow inner focus rectangle, the authors can negatively affect the focus appearance by making the button yellow or orange. For this reason, this user agent exception can only be met if the author both does not modify the default focus indicator <em>and</em> does not modify its background.</p>   <p>[Future image set: a button with a default internal focus indicator; the same button, now with a colour similar to the default internal focus indicator]</p>  </section>",

Examples are drag-and-drop gestures and on touch screens, swiping gestures, split taps, or long presses. This Guideline does not discourage the provision of complex and timed gestures by authors. However, where they are used, an alternative method of input should be provided to enable users with motor impairments to interact with content via single untimed pointer gestures.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Often, people use devices that offer several input methods, for example, mouse input, touch input, keyboard input, and speech input.

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content can be controlled with a range of pointing devices, abilities, and assistive technologies. Some people cannot perform gestures in a precise manner, or they may use a specialized or adapted input device such as a head pointer, eye-gaze system, or speech-controlled mouse emulator. Some pointing methods lack the capability or accuracy to perform multipoint or path-based gestures.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">A <strong>path-based gesture</strong> involves an interaction where not just the endpoints matter. If going through an intermediate point (usually near the start of the gesture) also affects its meaning then it is a path-based gesture. The user engages a pointer (starting point), carries out a movement that goes through at least one intermediate-point before disengaging the pointer (end point). The intermediate point defines the gesture as requiring a specific path, even if the complete path is not defined.</p><figure xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"figure-path-based-gesture-1\">  <img src=\"img/path-based-gesture-1.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Hand showing a starting touch, 1. Moving through a second point, 2. Going to one of several points,3.\"/>  <figcaption>A path-based gesture involves starting a pointer movement that goes through at least one intermediate point before the end-point. The end-point may be a continuation, or allow for various movements.</figcaption>  </figure><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Examples of path-based gestures include swiping, sliders and carousels dependent on the direction of interaction, and other gestures which trace a prescribed path such as drawing a specific shape. Such paths may be drawn with a finger or stylus on a touchscreen, graphics tablet, or trackpad, or with a mouse, joystick, or similar pointer device.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Dragging is a movement where the user picks up an object with a pointer (such as mouse cursor or a finger) and moves it to some other position. This movement from start point to end point does not require the user to follow any particular path or direction. Dragging is therefore not path-based. In contrast, a path-based pointer gesture requires the traversal of an intermediate point, which is a technical way of expressing that the directionality and possibly speed of the gesture communicates a particular command to the system. Dragging motions are covered in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging.html\">Success Criterion 2.5.7: Dragging</a>.</p><figure xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"figure-path-based-gesture-2\">  <img src=\"img/path-based-gesture-2.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Hand showing a starting touch, 1. Going to a second point, 2. It follows a very random path.\"/>  <figcaption>A free-form gesture does not require any particular path before the end-point, only the start and (optionally) the end point matter.</figcaption>  </figure><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">Any movement of a pointer could be difficult or impossible to use for someone who cannot perform precise movements, therefore alternative forms of interaction are always recommended. This success criterion is scoped to <em>path-based gestures</em> as it may be difficult or impossible to provide an alternative for free-form paths.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Examples of <strong>multipoint</strong> gestures include a two-finger pinch zoom, a split tap where one finger rests on the screen and a second finger taps, or a two- or three-finger tap or swipe. Users may find it difficult or impossible to accomplish these if they type and point with a single finger or stick.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Authors must ensure that their content can be operated without multipoint or path-based gestures. Multipoint or path-based gestures can be used so long as the functionality can also be operated by another method, such as a tap, click, double tap, double click, long press, or click &amp; hold. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This Success Criterion applies to gestures in the author-provided content, not gestures defined by the operating system, user agent, or assistive technology. Examples of operating system gestures would be swiping down to see system notifications and gestures for built-in assistive technologies (AT). Examples of user agent-implemented gestures would be horizontal swiping implemented by browsers for navigating within the page history, or vertical swiping to scroll page content.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">There are times when a component requires a path-based gesture for touch screen devices but not with a mouse. Taking an example of a generic slider:</p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <li><strong>Using a mouse:</strong> If the user clicks on the thumb control of the slider and moves vertically, the slider will respond by moving to the right or left, even if the movement is mostly upwards. There will be no page scrolling as a result of the vertical movement as long as they drag with focus on the slider. Therefore, the slider does not require a path-based gesture with mouse pointer.</li>  <li><strong>Using a touch-screen:</strong> If the user puts their finger on the thumb control of the slider and moves upwards more than sideways, the slider may not respond because the browser takes control of the swipe and interprets it as a scroll, and will move the page up and down. Moving left or right on the slider thumb engages the slider and then the user can vary their vertical movement. This implementation has the 3-point requirement to work with a finger on a touch screen device so is a path-based gesture.</li>  </ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">As touch screen devices can apply default gestures it is important to test with them if you are unsure whether a particular component does require a path-based gesture.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Browsers on a touch screen device generally provide some default gestures that impact whether a path-based gesture is needed. For example, a web browser on a touch-screen devices might detect a vertical gesture and scroll the page. If a user places their finger on a slider thumb and moves up (to scroll down) that might not activate the slider (depending on implementation). If the user moves horizontally first then the slider could capture that gesture and ignore vertical movement, resulting in a path-based gesture. If you include touch-screen devices as accessibility supported then these types of interaction need testing with a touch screen as using a mouse in a similar way would not trigger the same browser behavior.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This Success Criterion does not require all functionality to be available through pointing devices, but if it is available to pointer devices then it should not require path-based gestures. While content authors generally need to provide keyboard commands or other non-pointer mechanisms that perform actions equivalent to complex gestures (see Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard), this is not sufficient to conform to this Success Criterion. That is because some users rely entirely on pointing devices, or find simple pointer inputs much easier to perform and understand than alternatives. For example, a user relying on a head-pointer would find clicking a control to be much more convenient than activating an on-screen keyboard to emulate a keyboard shortcut, and a person who has difficulty memorizing a series of keys (or gestures) may find it much easier to simply click on a labeled control. Therefore, if one or more pointer-based mechanisms are supported, then their benefits should be afforded to users through simple, single-point actions alone.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Single pointer operations include taps and clicks, double-taps and double-clicks, long presses, swiping, dragging, and path-based gestures. Gestures such as \"pinch to zoom\" or two-finger swipes are <em>multipoint</em> gestures, as they require two or more pointer inputs - in this case, two fingers on a touchscreen.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">An exception is made for functionality that is inherently and necessarily based on complex paths or multipoint gestures. For example, entering your signature may be inherently path-based (although acknowledging something or confirming your identity need not be).</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Gestures that involve dragging in any direction are not in scope for this SC because only the start and end points matter in a dragging operation. However, such gestures do require fine motor control. Authors are encouraged to provide non-dragging methods, for instance, a drag and drop operation could also be achieved by selecting an item (with a tap or keyboard interaction) and then selecting its destination as a second step.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"benefits\">  <h3>Benefits</h3>  <ul>  <li><p>Users who cannot (accurately) perform path-based pointer gestures - on a touchscreen, or with a mouse - will have alternative means for operating the content.</p></li>  <li><p>Users who cannot perform multi-pointer gestures on a touchscreen (for instance, because they are operating the touchscreen with an alternative input such as a head pointer) will have a single-pointer alternative for operating the content.</p></li>  <li><p>Users who may not understand the custom gesture interaction intended by the author will be able to rely on simple, frequently used gestures to interact.

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this success criterion is to make it easier for users to prevent accidental or erroneous pointer input. People with various disabilities can inadvertently initiate touch or mouse events with unwanted results. Each of the following subsections roughly aligns with the bullets of this Success Criterion, and outlines a means of allowing users to cancel pointer operations.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Up-Event activation or completion</h3>  <p>The most accessible way to incorporate pointer cancellation is to make activation occur on the up-event.</p>  <p>Up-event activation refers to the activation of a target when the pointer is released. In a touchscreen interaction, when the finger touches a target, the up-event activation only occurs when the finger is lifted while still being within the target boundary. Similarly in mouse interaction, the up-event occurs when the mouse button is released while the cursor is still within the boundary of the initial target set when the mouse button was pressed.</p>  <p>Authors can reduce the problem of users inadvertently triggering an action by using generic platform activation/click events that activate functionality on the up-event. For example, the <code>click</code> event in JavaScript triggers on release of the primary mouse button, and is an example of an implicit up-event. Despite its name, the <code>click</code> event is device-independent and also works for touch and keyboard interaction.</p>  <p>The preference for up-events is implicit in the Success Criterion wording of the first bullet: <q>The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function.</q> Authors meet the first bullet by using only the up-event.</p> </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Up-Event Abort or Undo</h3>  <p>Where the interaction is equivalent to a simple \"click\", up-event activation has a built-in ability to cancel. There is a distinction between when someone touches a screen and when they remove their finger. Similarly, in mouse interaction, there is a difference between pressing and releasing the mouse button. When activation occurs only as the pointer is released, users have the opportunity to Abort (cancel) the activation. Users who have difficulty accurately using a mouse or touchscreen benefit greatly from this basic behaviour. They normally receive visual feedback when an item is pressed. If they discover they have selected the wrong item, they can cancel the action by moving their pointer or finger away from the target before releasing.</p>  <p>For more complex interactions, such as drag and drop, the down- and up-events may initiate and end a series of actions to complete a process. For example, with drag and drop, the item may be:</p>  <ol>  <li>selected with a press (down-event),</li>  <li>moved to a new location, while still being depressed, and</li>  <li>released (up-event) to conclude the drop action.</li> </ol> <p>In such a complex action, the need for an Abort or Undo function increases. Designers may elect to confirm the move through something like a confirmation dialog or an undo button, giving the user the ability to Undo the process just completed. Alternatively, the ability to Abort the action can be achieved if, before completing step 3, the user returns the selected item to its original location and concludes the process there. If other parts of the screen disallow a move, the user can conclude the drag and drop there, effectively nullifying the operation.</p> </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"> <h3>Up Reversal</h3> <p>In other interactions, the down-event may trigger a behaviour which can be reversed when the up-event concludes. Examples of this include press-and-hold actions such as where a transient popup appears (or a video plays) when the user presses on an object (down-event), but the popup (or video) disappears as soon as the user releases the pointer (up-event). Since the up-event reverses the preceding down event, the user is returned to their prior point, and has effectively cancelled the operation.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"> <h3>Down-Event</h3> <p>Completing the function on the down-event is only permitted when it is essential that the up-event not be used.</p> <p>The most prevalent essential down-event activation occurs in keyboard emulation. On a physical keyboard, keys by default activate on the down-event -- a letter appears when the key is pressed. If a software keyboard emulator tried to override this expected behaviour by making letters appear when the key is released, the behaviour would be unexpected and would adversely affect expected interaction.</p> <p>Note that a keyboard has a built-in Backspace or Delete button, which effectively provides an Undo option. Undo is not a requirement of the down-event Essential exception; however, providing an easy way for users to undo any action is a recommended practice (and may be a functional necessity), even where it is not a requirement of this Success Criterion.</p>  <p>Other examples where the timing of an activation is essential and requires the down-event would be:</p>  <ul>  <li>An activity that emulates a physical on-press trigger, such as when playing an on-screen piano keyboard. Activation on the up-event would significantly alter the desired behaviour.</li>  <li>A program for shooting skeets where waiting for the \"up\" event would invalidate the precise timing necessary for the activation.</li>  </ul>  </section>",

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that the words which visually label a component are also the words associated with the component programmatically. This helps ensure that people with disabilities can rely on visible labels as a means to interact with the components.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Most controls are accompanied by a visible text <strong>label</strong>. Those same controls have a programmatic <strong>name</strong>, also known as the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/\">Accessible Name</a>. Users typically have a much better experience if the words and characters in the visible label of a control match or are contained within the accessible name. When these match, speech-input users (i.e., users of speech recognition applications) can navigate by speaking the visible text labels of components, such as menus, links, and buttons, that appear on the screen. Sighted users who use text-to-speech (e.g., screen readers) will also have a better experience if the text they hear matches the text they see on the screen.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Note that where a visible text label does not exist for a component, this Success Criterion does not apply to that component.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Where text labels exist and are properly linked to the user interface components through established authoring practices, the label and name will normally match. When they don't match, speech-input users who attempt to use the visible text label as a means of navigation or selection (e.g., \"move to Password\") will be unsuccessful. The speech-based navigation fails because the visible label spoken by the users does not match (or is not part of) the accessible name that is enabled as a speech-input command. In addition, when the accessible name is different from the visible label, it may function as a hidden command that can be accidentally activated by speech-input users.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Mismatches between visible labels and programmatic names for controls are even more of an issue for speech-input and text-to-speech users who also have cognitive challenges. Mismatches create an extra cognitive load for speech-input users, who must remember to say a speech command that is different from the visible label they see on a control. It also creates extra cognitive load for a text-to-speech user to absorb and understand speech output that does not match the visible label.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">In order for the label text and accessible name to be matched, it is first necessary to determine which text on the screen should be considered a label for any given control. There are often multiple text strings in a user interface that may be relevant to a control. However, there are reasons why it is best to conservatively interpret the label as being only the text in close proximity.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Conventionally the label for user interface components is the adjacent text string. The typical positioning for left to right languages is:</p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><li>immediately to the left of comboboxes, dropdown lists, text inputs, and other widgets (or in the absence of left-side labels, immediately above and aligned with the left edge of each input)</li> <li>immediately to the right of checkboxes and radio buttons</li> <li>inside buttons and tabs or immediately below icons serving as buttons</li> </ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The rationale for some of these conventions is explained in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2016/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20160105/G162\">G162: Positioning labels to maximize predictability of relationships</a>. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">It is important to bias towards treating only the adjacent text as a label because liberal interpretations of what constitutes a text label can jeopardize the value of this Success Criterion (SC) by lessening predictability. Isolating the label to the single string in close proximity to the component makes it easier for developers, testers, and end users to identify the label targeted for evaluation in this SC. Predictable interpretation of labeling allows users of speech recognition technologies to interact with the element via its conventionally positioned label, and allows users of screen reading technologies to enjoy consistency between the nearby visible label and the announced name of the component.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Note that placeholder text within an input field is not considered an appropriate means of providing a label. The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#the-placeholder-attribute\">HTML5 specification</a> states <q>The placeholder attribute should not be used as an alternative to a &lt;label&gt;.</q> However, it is worth noting that \"label\" in that HTML5 statement is in code brackets and links to the <code>label</code> element. For the purposes of this Label in Name Success Criterion, \"label\" is not used in such a programmatic sense but is simply referring to a text string in close visual proximity to a component. As such, in the absence of any other nearby text string (as described in the preceding list), if an input contains placeholder text, such text may be a candidate for Label in Name. This is supported both through the accessible name calculation (discussed later) and from the practical sense that where a visible label is not otherwise provided, it is likely that a speech-input user may attempt to use the placeholder text value as a means of interacting with the input.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"> <h3>Text labels \"express something in human language\"</h3>  <section> <h4>Symbolic text characters</h4> <p>For the purposes of this SC, text should not be considered a visible label if it is used in a symbolic manner, rather than directly <q>expressing something in human language</q> as per the definition of <a>text</a> in WCAG. For example, <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#images-of-text\">1.4.5 Images of Text</a> describes considerations for \"symbolic text characters.\" In the images of text example \"B\", \"I\", and \"ABC\" appear on icons in a text editor, where they are meant to symbolize the functions for Bold, Italics, and Spelling, respectively. In such a case, the accessible name should be the function the button serves (e.g., \"Spell check\" or \"Check spelling\"), not the visible symbolic characters. A similar text editor is shown in the figure below.</p> <figure id=\"figure-RTE-github\">  <img alt=\"Icons for transforming text, including heading, bold, italic, quote, code, and link, along with icons for ordered and unordered lists and other controls\" src=\"img/rich-text-editor-detail.png\"/>  <figcaption>A detail of the rich text editor in Github, showing a variety of unlabeled icons, including icons resembling text characters.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Likewise, where an author has used a greater-than symbol (\"&gt;\") to mimic the appearance of the right-facing arrow, the text does not convey something in human language. It is a symbol, in this scenario likely meant to mimic the icons used for a \"Play\" button or a \"Next\" arrow.</p> <h4>Punctuation and capitalization</h4>  </section>  <section> <p>The use of punctuation and capitalization in labels <em>may</em> also be considered optional for the same reason. For example, the colon conventionally added at the end of input labels does not express something in human language, and capitals on the first letter of each word in a label do not normally alter the words' meaning. This is particularly relevant in the context of this SC, since it is primarily aimed at users of speech recognition; capitals and most punctuation are frequently ignored when a user speaks a label as a means of interacting with a control.</p> <p>While it is certainly not an error to include the colon and capitalization in the accessible name, a computed name of \"First name\" should not be considered a failure of \"First Name:\".<br/> <label for=\"firstname\">First Name: </label><input id=\"firstname\" type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\"/><br/> Likewise, \"Next…\" visibly shown on a button could have \"Next\" as the accessible name. When in doubt, where a meaningful visible label exists, match the string exactly for the accessible name.<br/> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Next...\"/></p>  </section>  <section>  <h4>Mathematical expressions and formulae</h4> <p>Mathematical expressions are an exception to the previous subsection about symbolic characters. Math symbols can be used as labels; for example \"11×3=33\" and \"A&gt;B\" convey meaning. The label should not be overwritten in the accessible name, and substitutions of words where a formula is used should be avoided since there are multiple ways to express the same equation. For example, making the name \"eleven multiplied by three is equivalent to thirty-three\" might mean a user who said \"eleven times three equals thirty-three\" may not match. It is best to leave the formulas as used in the label and count on the user's familiarity with their speech software to achieve a match. Further, converting a mathematical formula label into an accessible name that is a spelled-out equivalent may create issues for translation. The name should match the label's formula text. Note that a consideration for authors is to use the proper symbol in the formula. For instance 11x3 (with a lower or upper case letter X), 11*3 (with the asterisk symbol), and 11×3 (with the <code>&amp;</code>times<code>;</code> symbol) are all easy for sighted users to interpret as meaning the same formula, but may not all be matched to \"11 times 3\" by the speech recognition software. The proper operator symbol (in this case the times symbol) should be used.<br/>   <input type=\"radio\" name=\"equation\" id=\"answer1\" value=\"A&gt;B\"/><label for=\"answer1\">A&gt;B</label>  <input type=\"radio\" name=\"equation\" id=\"answer2\" value=\"A=B\"/><label for=\"answer2\">A=B</label>  <input type=\"radio\" name=\"equation\" id=\"answer3\" value=\"A&lt;B\"/><label for=\"answer3\">A&lt;B</label></p>  </section>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">   <h3>Accessible Name and Description Computation specification</h3>  <p>It is important to understand how the accessible name is derived. The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/\">Accessible Name and Description Computation 1.1</a> and the <a href=\"https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/#accessible-name-and-description-computation\">HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0</a> describe how the accessible name is computed, including which attributes are considered in its calculation, and in what order of preference. If a component has multiple possible attribute values that could be used for its accessible name, only the most preferred of those values will be computed. None of the other, less preferred values will be part of the name. For the most part, existing established programmatic relationships between labels and controls are reinforced by the specification.</p>  <p>Other text displayed on the screen that is correctly coded to meet 1.3.1: Info and Relationships is <strong>not</strong> normally factored into the calculation for the accessible name of a UI component without author intervention (via ARIA labeling techniques). The most common of these are:</p>  <ul>  <li>headings and instructions</li> <li>group labels for sets of components (i.e., used with <code>legend</code>/<code>fieldset</code> or with role of <code>group</code> or <code>radiogroup</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Such textual information may constitute part of the component's <em>description</em>. So from both a programmatic viewpoint, and from the conservative tactic of only considering a label to be \"adjacent text,\" neither headings, instructions, nor group 'labels' should normally be considered <strong>labels</strong> for the purpose of this Success Criterion.</p>  <p>It is important to note that the specification allows authors to override the name calculated through native semantics. Both <code>aria-label</code> and <code>aria-labelledby</code> take precedence in the name calculation, overriding the visible text as the accessible name even when the visible text label is programmatically associated with the control. For this reason, when a visible label already exists, <code>aria-label</code> should be avoided or used carefully, and <code>aria-labelledby</code> should be used as a supplement with care.</p> <p>Finally, <code>aria-describedby</code> is not included in the Accessible Name computation (instead it is part of the Accessible Description computation). By convention, text associated with a control through <code>aria-describedby</code> is announced immediately after the accessible name by screen readers. Therefore, the context of headings, instructions, and group labels can be provided through the accessible description to assist users of screen readers without affecting the experience of those who navigate using speech recognition software.</p>  </section>",

An alternative method must be provided so that users with mobility impairments who use a pointer (mouse, pen, or touch contact) can use the functionality.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This requirement is separate from keyboard accessibility because people using a touch screen device may not use a physical keyboard. Keyboard specific interactions such as tabbing or arrow keys may not be possible when encountering a drag and drop control. Note, however, that providing a text input can be an acceptable single-pointer alternative to dragging. For example, an input beside a slider could allow any user to enter a precise value for the slider. In such a situation, the on-screen keyboard that appears for touch users offers a single-pointer means of entering an alphanumeric value.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This criterion does not apply to scrolling enabled by the user-agent. Scrolling a page is not in scope, nor is using a technique such as <abbr title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS</abbr> <code>overflow</code> to make a section of content scrollable.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Relationship to other requirements</h3>  <p>Success Criteria 2.1.1 Keyboard and 2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) require dragging features to be keyboard accessible. However, achieving keyboard equivalence for a dragging operation does not automatically meet this Success Criterion. It is possible to create an interface that works with dragging and keyboard controls that does not work using only clicks or taps. While many designs can be created for a dragging alternative which address both keyboard accessibility and operability by single pointer operation, the two requirements should be assessed independently.</p>   <p>This Success Criterion applies to dragging movements as opposed to pointer gestures, which are covered in <a href=\"pointer-gestures\">Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures</a>. Pointer gestures include directional path-based as well as multi-point gestures. In contrast, for dragging movements, only the start and end point of the movement matters, not the actual path.</p>   <p>Additional examples are selection rectangles that set the first x/y rectangle coordinate at the pointer position via a pointer down-event, and the second x/y coordinate, after a dragging movement, at the next up-event. A similar example is a connecting line drawn between two different items on the screen, as in an allocation test where users are required to draw a line between questions and corresponding answers. In these cases, the dragging movement requires an alternative way to accomplish the same action that does not rely on the dragging movement. For example, two separate single tap or click actions may define the rectangle coordinates or the start and end points of a connecting line.</p>   </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Alternatives for dragging movements on the same page</h3>  <p>Where functionality can be executed via dragging movements and an equivalent option exists that allows for single-pointer access without dragging, this Success Criterion is passed. It does not have to be the same component, so long as the functionality is equivalent. An example is a color wheel where a color can be changed by dragging an indicator. In addition, text fields for the numerical input of color values allow the definition of a color without requiring dragging movements. (Note that a text input is considered device agnostic; although the purpose is to enter characters, text entry can take place through voice, pointer or keyboard.)</p> </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <h3>Distinguishing dragging movements from path-based pointer gestures</h3>  <p>Dragging movements covered in this Success Criterion are pointer interactions where only the start- and endpoints matter. Once the pointer engages with a target, the direction of the dragging movement does not factor into the interaction until the pointer disengages the target. Since the dragging movement does not have an intermediate point, the dragging movement can go in any direction. Path-based gestures are covered in Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures.

Users with dexterity limitations and those who have difficulty with fine motor movement find it difficult to accurately activate small targets when there are other targets that are too close. Providing sufficient size, or sufficient spacing between targets, will reduce the likelihood of accidentally activating the wrong control.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Disabilities addressed by this requirement include hand tremors, spasticity, and quadriplegia. Some people with disabilities use specialized input devices instead of a computer mouse or trackpad. Typically these types of input device do not provide as much accuracy as mainstream pointing devices. Meeting this requirement also ensures that touchscreen interfaces are easier to use.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">This Success Criterion defines a <em>minimum size</em> and, if this can't be met, a <em>minimum spacing</em>. It is still possible to have very small, and difficult to activate, targets and meet the requirements of this Success Criterion, provided that the targets don't have any adjacent targets that are too close. However, using larger target sizes will help many people use targets more easily. <em>As a best practice</em> it is recommended to at least meet the <em>minimum size</em> requirement of the Success Criterion, regardless of spacing. For important links/controls, consider aiming for the stricter <a href=\"../21/target-size-enhanced.html\">2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced)</a>.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"exceptions\">  <h3>Exceptions</h3>  <p>The requirement is for targets to be at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels in size. There are five exceptions:</p>   <ul>  <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Undersized targets (those less than 24 by 24 CSS pixels) are positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the <a>bounding box</a> of each, the circles do not intersect another target or the circle for another undersized target.</li>  <li><strong>Equivalent:</strong> In cases where a target does not have a size equivalent to 24 by 24 CSS pixels, but there is another control that can achieve the underlying function that <em>does</em> meet the minimum size, the target can be excepted based on the \"Equivalent\" exception.</li>  <li><strong>Inline:</strong> The Success Criterion does not apply to inline targets in sentences, or where the size of the target is constrained by the line-height of non-target text. This exception is allowed because text reflow based on viewport size makes it impossible for authors to anticipate where links may be positioned relative to one another. When multiple links are embedded in blocks of texts in smaller text sizes, guaranteeing that undersized links in adjacent lines of text fulfill the spacing exception (their 24 CSS pixel diameter circle don't intersect any other links or their circles) would require a large line height which can be undesirable in many design contexts.</li>  <li><strong>User agent control:</strong> Browsers have default renderings of some controls, such as the days of the month calendar in an <code>&lt;input type=\"date\"&gt;</code>. As long as the author has not modified the user agent default, the target size for a <q>User agent control</q> is excepted.</li>  <li><strong>Essential:</strong> If the size and spacing of the targets is fundamental to the information being conveyed, the <q>Essential</q> exception applies. For example, in digital maps, the position of pins is analogous to the position of places shown on the map. If there are many pins close together, the spacing between pins and neighboring pins will often be below 24 CSS pixels. It is essential to show the pins at the correct map location, therefore the Essential exception applies. A similar example is an interactive data visualization where targets are necessarily dense. Another example is where jurisdictions legally require online forms to replicate paper forms, which can impose constraints on the size of targets. In such jurisdictions, any legal requirement to replicate small targets can be considered essential. When the essential exception is applicable, authors are strongly encouraged to provide equivalent functionality through alternative means to the extent practical.</li>  </ul>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"size-requirement\">  <h3>Size requirement</h3>   <p>For a target to be \"at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels\", it must be possible to draw a solid 24 by 24 CSS pixel square, aligned to the horizontal and vertical axis such that the square is completely within the target (does not extend outside the target's area).</p>   <figure id=\"target-size-basic\">  <img src=\"img/target-size-basic.svg\" width=\"180\" height=\"75\" alt=\"Three square boxes next to each other, each with a height and width of 24px\"/>  <figcaption>Where targets are a 24 by 24px square (and larger is better), they meet the size requirement of the criterion and pass (image shown to scale - <a href=\"img/target-size-basic.svg\">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>The 24 by 24px square has to be aligned with the page, although the target itself could be skewed.</p>   <figure id=\"target-size-skewed\">  <img src=\"img/target-size-skewed.svg\" width=\"130\" height=\"120\" alt=\"A skewed rectangle that includes a 24 by 24px square within it.\"/>  <figcaption>So long as there is a solid 24 by 24px square within the target, it meets the size requirement of the criterion and passes (image shown to scale - <a href=\"img/target-size-skewed.svg\">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>If a target is not large enough to allow for a 24 by 24px square to be drawn inside it, it is considered <em>undersized</em>, and does not pass the size requirement of the Success Criterion.

This means that authors cannot meet it by claiming that the target will have enough spacing or sufficient size if the user zooms into the page.</p>  <p>The requirement does not apply to targets while they are obscured by content displayed as a result of a user interaction or scripted behavior of content, for example:</p>   <ul>  <li>interacting with a combobox shows a dropdown list of suggestions</li>  <li>activating a button displays a modal dialog</li>  <li>content displays a cookie banner after page load</li>  <li>content displays a \"Take a survey\" dialog after some period of user inactivity</li>  </ul> <p>The requirement does however apply to targets in any new content that appears on top of other content.</p>   <p>While the Success Criterion primarily helps touch users by providing target sizing to prevent accidental triggering of adjacent targets, it is also useful for mouse or pen users. It reduces the chances of erroneous activation due to either a tremor or reduced precision, whether because of reduced fine motor control or input imprecision.</p>   </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"spacing\">  <h3>Spacing</h3>   <p>When the minimum size for a target is not met, spacing can at least improve the user experience. There is less chance of accidentally activating a neighboring target if a target is not immediately adjacent to another. Touchscreen devices and user agents generally have internal heuristics to identify which link or control is closest to a user's touch interaction - this means that sufficient spacing between targets can work as effectively as a larger target size itself.</p>   <p>When a target is smaller than 24 by 24 CSS pixels, it is <em>undersized</em>. In this case, we check if it at least has sufficient <em>spacing</em> by drawing a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle over the undersized target, centered on the target's <a>bounding box</a>. For rectangular targets, the bounding box coincides with the target itself – thus, the circle is placed on the center of the target. If the target is <em>not</em> rectangular – for instance, if the target is clipped, has rounded corners, or if it's a more complex clickable SVG shape – we need to first determine the bounding box, and then find the box's center. Note that for concave shapes, the center of the bounding box may be outside of the target itself. Now, we center the circle on the center of the bounding box.</p>   <figure id=\"target-size-bounding-boxes\">  <img src=\"img/target-size-bounding-boxes.svg\" width=\"395\" height=\"100\" alt=\"Three undersized targets - a square target, a convex target, and a concave target; the concave and convex targets have a bounding box around them; all three targets have a 24 CSS pixel circle centered on the center of their bounding box\"/>  <figcaption>For a square/rectangular target, the 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the target itself. For convex and concave targets, it is centered on the bounding box of the shape. Note the concave target, where in this case the center of the bounding box is outside of the actual target (image shown to scale - <a href=\"img/target-size-bounding-boxes.svg\">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>We repeat this process for all adjacent undersized targets. To determine if an undersized target has sufficient spacing (to pass this Success Criterion's spacing exception), we check that the 24 CSS pixel diameter circle of the target does not intersect another target or the circle of any other adjacent undersized targets.</p>   <p>The following example shows a horizontal row of icon-based buttons. In the top row, the dimensions of each target are 24 by 24 CSS pixels, passing this Success Criterion. In the second row, the same targets are only 20 by 20 CSS pixels, but have a 4 CSS pixel space between them – as the target size is below 24 by 24 CSS pixels, these need to be evaluated against the Success Criterion's spacing exception, and they pass. In the last row, the targets are again 20 by 20 CSS pixels, but have no space between them – these fail the spacing exception, because when drawing the 24 CSS pixel diameter circles over the targets, the circles intersect.</p>   <figure id=\"target-spacing-toolbar\">  <img src=\"img/target-spacing-toolbar.svg\" width=\"560\" height=\"265\" alt=\"Three rows showing a horizontal toolbar of icon-based controls with measurements.

In the FAIL example, the menu items are only 18 CSS pixels high, meaning that the 24 CSS pixel spacing circles of the targets in one row will intersect the adjacent menu item targets and circles (image shown to scale - <a href=\"img/target-dropdown.svg\">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>  </figure>   <p>The following example has one large target (an image that links to a new page related to that image) and a very small second target (a control with a magnifier icon, to open a zoomed-in preview, possibly in a modal, of the image itself). In the top row, the small target overlaps - or, to be more technically accurate, clips - the large target. The small target itself has a size of 24 by 24 CSS pixels, so passes. In the second row, we see that if the second target is any smaller – in this case 16 by 16 CSS pixels – it fails the criterion, as the circle with a 24 CSS pixel diameter we draw over the small target will intersect the large target itself.</p>   <figure id=\"target-large-small-clipping\">  <img src=\"img/target-large-small-clipping.svg\" width=\"460\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Two rows showing a small target clipping a large target\"/>  <figcaption>Two rows with a small target clipping (overlapping) a large target.

This time, the small target touches/abuts the large target. If the small target is smaller than 24 by 24 CSS pixels, the circle with a 24 CSS pixel diameter we draw over the small target will intersect the large target itself, failing the requirement. The undersized target must be spaced further away from the large target until its circle doesn't intersect the large target.</p>   <figure id=\"target-large-small-touching\">  <img src=\"img/target-large-small-touching.svg\" width=\"460\" height=\"320\" alt=\"Two rows showing a small target and a large target touching/abutting\"/>  <figcaption>In the first row, the 16 by 16 CSS pixel target touching/abutting the large target fails, as its 24 CSS pixel diameter circle used for undersized targets intersects the large target. In the second row we see that the only way the undersized target can pass is by adding a 4 CSS pixel spacing gap between the targets (image shown to scale - <a href=\"img/target-large-small-touching.svg\">see the scalable original version</a>)</figcaption>  </figure>   <p class=\"note\">Users with different disabilities have different needs for control sizes. It can be beneficial to provide an option to increase the active target area without increasing the visible target size. Another option is to provide a mechanism to control the density of layout and thereby change target size or spacing, or both. This can be beneficial for a wide range of users. For example, users with visual field loss may prefer a more condensed layout with smaller sized controls while users with other forms of low vision may prefer large controls.</p>  </section>",

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user agents can correctly present  phrases, passages, and in some cases words written in multiple languages. This makes it possible for user agents and  assistive technologies to present content according to the presentation and pronunciation  rules for that language. This applies to graphical browsers as well as screen readers,  braille displays, and other voice browsers.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately  if the language of each passage of text is identified. Screen readers can use the  pronunciation rules of the language of the text. Visual browsers can display characters  and scripts in appropriate ways. This is especially important when switching between  languages that read from left to right and languages that read from right to left,  or when text is rendered in a language that uses a different alphabet. Users with  disabilities who know all the languages used in the Web page will be better able to  understand the content when each passage is rendered appropriately. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">When no other language has been specified for a phrase or passage of text, its human  language is the default human language of the Web page (see <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page.html\">Success Criterion 3.1.1</a>). So the human language of all content in single language documents can be programmatically  determined. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Individual words or phrases in one language can become part of another language. For  example, \"rendezvous\" is a French word that has been adopted in English, appears in  English dictionaries, and is properly pronounced by English screen readers. Hence  a passage of English text may contain the word \"rendezvous\" without specifying that  its human language is French and still satisfy this Success Criterion. Frequently,  when the human language of text appears to be changing for a single word, that word  has become part of the language of the surrounding text. Because this is so common  in some languages, single words should be considered part of the language of the surrounding  text unless it is clear that a change in language was intended. If there is doubt  whether a change in language is intended, consider whether the word would be pronounced  the same (except for accent or intonation) in the language of the immediately surrounding  text.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Most professions require frequent use of technical terms which may originate from  a foreign language. Such terms are usually not translated to all languages. The universal  nature of technical terms also facilitate communication between professionals.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Some common examples of technical terms include: Homo sapiens, Alpha Centauri, hertz,  and habeas corpus.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Identifying changes in language is important for a number of reasons:</p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <li>It allows braille translation software to follow changes in language, e.g., substitute  control codes for accented characters, and insert control codes necessary to prevent  erroneous creation of Grade 2 braille contractions.  </li>  <li>Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages will be able to speak the text  in the appropriate accent with proper pronunciation. If changes are not marked, the  synthesizer will try its best to speak the words in the default language it works  in. Thus, the French word for car, \"<span lang=\"fr\">voiture</span>\" would be pronounced \"voyture\" by a speech  synthesizer that uses English as its default language. </li>  <li>Marking changes in language can benefit future developments in technology, for example  users who are unable to translate between languages themselves will be able to use  machines to translate unfamiliar languages. </li>  <li>Marking changes in language can also assist user agents in providing definitions using  a dictionary. </li>  </ul>",

Text difficulty is described  in terms of the level of education required to read the text. Education levels are  defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education [[UNESCO]], which was created to allow international comparison among systems of education.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Difficult or complex text may be appropriate for most members of the intended audience  (that is, most of the people for whom the content has been created). But there are  people with disabilities, including reading disabilities, even among highly educated  users with specialized knowledge of the subject matter. It may be possible to accommodate  these users by making the text more readable. If the text cannot be made more readable,  then supplemental content is needed. Supplemental content is required when text demands  reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level—that is, more  than nine years of school. Such text presents severe obstacles to people with reading  disabilities and is considered difficult even for people without disabilities who  have completed upper secondary education.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Reading disabilities such as dyslexia make it difficult to recognize written or printed  words and associate them with the correct sounds. This is called \"decoding\" the text.  Decoding must be automatic in order for people to read fluently. The act of decoding  text word by word consumes much of the mental energy that most people are able to  use for understanding what they read.  Text that uses short, common words and short sentences is easier to decode and usually  requires less advanced reading ability than text that uses long sentences and long  or unfamiliar words.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The education level required to read text content (also called \"readability\") is measured  by analyzing selected passages of text from the Web page. If the Web page includes  text written for different purposes or different styles are used, the selected passages  include samples of the types of content in the Web page and the different styles in  which the content is written. (In many cases, the Web page contains only one kind  of text content—e.g., technical documentation, a legal notice, marketing material,  etc.—and all the content uses the same style.) </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Educators can also measure the education level required to read text content. For  example, qualified teachers can evaluate text according to local education standards  to determine if it requires reading ability beyond what is expected for students in  the last year of lower secondary education.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Because people's names, the names of cities or other proper names cannot be changed  to shorter names with fewer syllables, and because doing so or just referring to everyone  by pronouns can make sentences harder to understand, the success criterion specifies  that proper names can be ignored or removed from the text before assessing whether  it meets the reading ability requirement. Titles refer to the name of documents, books,  movies, etc. Titles are removed or ignored for the analysis because changing the words  in titles might make the titles easier to read but would make it impossible to understand  the item to which the title refers. This would make it harder to read and understand  the content. (e.g., a book, academic paper, article, etc.). Therefore, titles are  also exempted specifically. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">When a Web page contains multiple languages, a readability result should be calculated  for each language that constitutes at least 5% of the content and that is used in  full sentences or paragraphs (not just individual words or phrases). The overall readability  of the page should be judged on the language that yields the worst readability results.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The readability of content may also be determined by applying a readability formula  to the selected passage. Many (though not all) readability formulas base their calculations  on passages of 100 words. Such formulas have been developed for many languages. The  number of words in the passage is counted and the length of the words is determined  by counting either the number of syllables or the number of characters. Most readability  formulas also count the number and length of sentences. The average length of words  and sentences in the content is then used to calculate a readability score. (Some  languages, such as Japanese, may include multiple scripts within the same passage.  Readability formulas for these languages may use the number and length of such \"runs\"  in their calculations.) The result may be presented as a number (for example, on  a scale from 0-100) or as a grade level. These results can then be interpreted using  the education levels described in the International Standard Classification of Education.  Readability formulas are available for at least some languages when running the spell  checkers in popular software if you specify in the options of this engine that you  want to have the statistics when it has finished checking your documents.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Adapted from International Standard Classification of Education  [[UNESCO]] </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>According to the Open Society Mental Health Initiative, the concept of Easy to Read  cannot be universal, and it will not be possible to write a text that will suit the  abilities of all people with literacy and comprehension problems. Using the clearest  and simplest language appropriate is highly desirable, but the WCAG Working Group  could not find a way to test whether this had been achieved. The use of reading level  is a way to introduce testability into a Success Criterion that encourages clear writing.  Supplementary content can be a powerful technique for people with some classes of  cognitive disability. </p>  </div>",

Often words or characters have different meanings,  each with its own pronunciation. The meaning of such words or characters can usually  be determined from the context of the sentence. However, for more complex or ambiguous  sentences, or for some languages, the meaning of the word cannot be easily determined  or determined at all without knowing the pronunciation. When the sentence is read  aloud and the screen reader reads the word using the wrong pronunciation, it can be  even more difficult to understand than when read visually. When words are ambiguous  or indeterminate unless the pronunciation is known, then providing some means of determining  the pronunciation is needed.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  For example, in the English language heteronyms are words that are spelled the same  but have different pronunciations and meanings, such as the words desert (abandon)  and desert (arid region). If the proper pronunciation can be determined from the context  of the sentence, then nothing is required. If it cannot then some mechanism for determining  the proper pronunciation would be required. Additionally, in some languages certain  characters can be pronounced in different ways. In Japanese, for example, there are  characters like Han characters(Kanji) that have multiple pronunciations. Screen readers  may speak the characters incorrectly without the information on pronunciation. When  read incorrectly, the content will not make sense to users.  </p>",

It is difficult for some users to form an  overview of the Web page: screen readers present content as a one-dimensional stream  of synthetic speech that makes it difficult to understand spatial relationships. Users  with cognitive limitations may become confused if components appear in different places  on different pages.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For example, people who use screen magnifiers see only part of the screen at any point  in time; a consistent layout makes it easier for them to find navigation bars and  other components. Placing repeated components in the same relative order within a  set of Web pages allows users with reading disabilities to focus on an area of the  screen rather than spending additional time decoding the text of each link. Users  with limited use of their hands can more easily determine how to complete their tasks  using the fewest keystrokes.  </p>",

When the placement of the help mechanism is kept consistent across a set of pages, users looking for help will find it easier to identify. This is distinct from interface-level help, such as contextual help, features like spell checkers, and instructional text in a form. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Locating the help mechanism in a consistent location across pages makes it easier for users to find it. For example, when a mechanism or link is located in the header of one Web page, it will be easier to find if it is in the header of other pages. The help mechanism, such as a contact phone number, may be provided directly on the page, or it may also be a direct link to a contact page. Regardless of which approach is used, the mechanism must be located in the same relative order on each page within the set of pages.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">When testing this Success Criterion, it is the help item which is relative to the rest of the content. When testing a page, other content that is present across the set of web pages and is before the help item should be before the help item on this page. Items which are after the help item on other pages should be after the help item on this page.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">If the help item is visually in a different location, but in the same serial order, that is not helpful from a user's point of view, but it would not fail this criterion.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The location in a smaller viewport may be different than in a larger viewport, but it is best if the mechanism or link is consistent across a set of web pages. A consistent location, both visually and programmatically, is the most usable.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">When having problems completing a task on a Web site (or part of a Web site, what we call a <a>set of Web pages</a>), people with some types of disabilities may not be able to work through the issue without further help. Issues could include difficulty:  completing a form, or finding a document or page which provides information required to complete a task.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Without help, some users may abandon the task. They may also fail to correctly complete a task, or they may require assistance from people who do not necessarily keep private information secure.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">It is not the intent of this Success Criterion to require authors to provide help / access to help. The Criterion only requires that <em>when</em> one of the listed forms of help is available across multiple pages that it be in a consistent location. It does not require authors to provide help information on PDFs or other static documents that may be available for viewing/download from the Web pages. PDFs and other static documents are not considered part of the \"set of web pages\" from which they are downloaded.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">It is also not the intent of this Success Criterion to require a human be available at all times.

For example, an online jobs / recruitment portal may provide a contact method for the team that supports the recruitment portal and not a catch-all for the entire company. Each layer of contact added prolongs the time before the user will receive help.</p>   <p>The human contact mechanism enables a person to express what they are looking for using their own words. For some with cognitive disabilities, this may be the best way for them to find an answer to their problem.</p>   <p>For pages for which no human support is available it helps if a self-help option says that no human support is available. Self-help options can go beyond allowing the user to search within the site. Contextual help is still recommended (see <a href=\"help\">Success Criterion 3.3.5</a> for more information), but a self-help option provides a single location that makes it easier for people with cognitive disabilities to understand what help is available without having to hunt for it. While some people may easily be able to identify that no support would be available for a particular type of Web site, this may not be apparent to some users with disabilities.</p>   <p>Chatbots can work for many people, and particularly for people with cognitive disabilities if they:</p>   <ul>  <li>recognize misspelled words,</li>  <li>provide human contact details if the chatbot is unable to provide a satisfactory response after 3 attempts, and</li>  <li>can be dismissed with a single interaction, and recalled using a link or button.</li>  </ul>   <p>This criterion does not require that a site provide a help mechanism.

Typical error indication methods may not be obvious to them because  of a limited field of view, limited color perception, or use of assistive technology.

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that users are aware that an error  has occurred and can determine what is wrong. The error message should be as specific  as possible. In the case of an unsuccessful form submission, re-displaying the form and indicating  the fields in error is insufficient for some users to perceive that an error has occurred.  Screen reader users, for example, will not know there was an error until they encounter  one of the indicators. They may abandon the form altogether before encountering the  error indicator, thinking that the page simply is not functional. Per the definition in WCAG 2.0, an \"input error\" is information provided by the user  that is not accepted. This includes: </p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <li>information that is required by the web page but omitted by the user, or</li>  <li>information that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data  format or allowed values.  </li>  </ul><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">For example:</p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <li>the user fails to enter the proper abbreviation in to state, province, region, etc.  field; </li>  <li>the user enters a state abbreviation that is not a valid state; </li>  <li>the user enters a non existent zip or postal code;</li>  <li>the user enters a birth date 2 years in the future;</li>  <li>the user enters alphabetic characters or parentheses into their phone number field  that only accepts numbers;  </li>  <li>the user enters a bid that is below the previous bid or the minimum bid increment.</li>  </ul><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>If a user enters a value that is too high or too low, and the coding on the page automatically  changes that value to fall within the allowed range, the user's error would still  need to be described to them as required by the success criterion. Such an error description  telling the person of the changed value would meet both this success criterion (Error  Identification) and <a href=\"error-suggestion\" class=\"understanding\">Success Criterion 3.3.3 (Error Suggestion)</a>. </p>  </div><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The identification and description of an error can be combined with programmatic information  that user agents or assistive technologies can use to identify an error and provide  error information to the user. For example, certain technologies can specify that  the user's input must not fall outside a specific range, or that a form field is required.  Currently, few technologies support this kind of programmatic information, but the  Success Criterion does not require, nor prevent it.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">It is perfectly acceptable to indicate the error in other ways such as image, color  etc, in addition to the text description. </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">See also <a href=\"error-suggestion\">3.3.3: Error Suggestion</a>.  </p>",

			"intent": "<p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid serious  consequences as the result of a mistake when performing an action that cannot be reversed.  For example, purchasing non-refundable airline tickets or submitting an order to purchase  stock in a brokerage account are financial transactions with serious consequences.  If a user has made a mistake on the date of air travel, he or she could end up with  a ticket for the wrong day that cannot be exchanged. If the user made a mistake on  the number of stock shares to be purchased, he or she could end up purchasing more  stock than intended. Both of these types of mistakes involve transactions that take  place immediately and cannot be altered afterwards, and can be very costly. Likewise,  it may be an unrecoverable error if users unintentionally modify or delete data stored  in a database that they later need to access, such as their entire travel profile  in a travel services web site. When referring to modification or deletion of 'user  controllable' data, the intent is to prevent mass loss of data such as deleting a  file or record. It is not the intent to require a confirmation for each save command  or the simple creation or editing of documents, records or other data.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes. People with reading disabilities  may transpose numbers and letters, and those with motor disabilities may hit keys  by mistake. Providing the ability to reverse actions allows users to correct a mistake  that could result in serious consequences. Providing the ability to review and correct  information gives the user an opportunity to detect a mistake before taking an action  that has serious consequences.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">User-controllable data is user-viewable data that the user can change and/or delete  through an intentional action. Examples of the user controlling such data would be  updating the phone number and address for the user's account, or deleting a record  of past invoices from a website. It does not refer such things as internet logs and  search engine monitoring data that the user can't view or interact with directly.  </p>",

Users with learning, and cognitive disabilities are highly susceptible to mental fatigue.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Requiring people to recall information previously entered can cause them to give up or re-enter the same information incorrectly.

A <a>process</a> is defined on the basis of an activity and is not applicable when a user returns after closing a session or navigating away.

Ideally, it would be visible by default and closely associated with the input where the data is required. However, it could be elsewhere on a page, including within a show/hide component.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This Success Criterion does not apply if data is provided by the user with a different method, such as uploading a resume in a document format.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This Success Criterion does not impact <a href=\"accessible-authentication.html\">Accessible Authentication</a>, for which allowing auto-filling of passwords is a sufficient technique.

It is possible to eliminate redundant entry in ways that do not introduce additional privacy risks, but it is also possible that a poor implementation (for meeting this criterion) could leak additional PII.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">There are exceptions for:</p><ul xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <li>Essential uses of input re-entry for things like memory games which would be invalidated if the previous answers were supplied.</li>  <li>Security measures such as preventing a password string from being shown or copied.

Refer to <a href=\"accessible-authentication-enhanced\">Accessible Authentication (Enhanced)</a> for guidance to be more inclusive and accessible.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"cog-fun-tests\">  <h3>Cognitive Function Tests</h3>  <p>Remembering a site-specific password is a <a>cognitive function test</a>. Such tests are known to be problematic for many people with cognitive disabilities. Whether it is remembering random strings of characters, or a pattern gesture to perform on a touch screen, cognitive function tests will exclude some people. When a cognitive function test is used, at least one other authentication method must be available which is not a cognitive function test.</p>    <p>If there is more than one step in the authentication process, such as with multi-factor authentication, all steps need to comply with this Success Criterion to pass. There needs to be a path through authentication that does not rely on cognitive function tests.</p>   <p>Being able to recover or change the email and password is an important part of authentication. If the user is authenticating with alternative information in order to recover their account, there needs to be a method that is not a cognitive function test.</p>   <p>Many organizations are required to use 2-factor authentication that combines independent sources to confirm a user's identity. These sources can consist of combining authentication through:</p>   <ul>  <li>knowledge (e.g., password, letters in a passphrase or memorized swipe path);</li>  <li>possession (e.g., a verification code generated or received on a device, or scanning of a QR code on an external device);</li>  <li>biometrics (e.g., fingerprint scanning, facial recognition or keystroke dynamics).</li>  </ul>   <p>Most knowledge-based authentication methods rely on a cognitive function test, so mechanisms to assist users must be available. When authentication relies on performing an action on a separate device, it should be possible to complete the action without the need to transcribe information. It may not be possible to know what device-based authentication methods are available to a user; offering a choice of methods can allow them to choose the path that most suits them.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"auth-approaches\">  <h3>Authentication Approaches</h3>  <p>Web sites can employ username (or email) and password inputs as an authentication method if the author enables the user agent (browsers and third-party password managers) to fill in the fields automatically. Generally, if the login form meets <a href=\"identify-input-purpose\">Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose</a>, and the form controls have an appropriate accessible name in accordance with <a href=\"name-role-value\">Success Criterion 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value</a>, the user agent should be able to reliably recognize the fields and automatically fill them in. However, if the user agent is actively blocked from filling in the fields (for instance, by a script), then the page would not pass this criterion because it prevents the mechanism from working.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"copy-paste\">  <h3>Copy and paste</h3>  <p>Copy and paste can be relied on to avoid transcription. Users can copy their login credentials from a local source (such as a standalone third-party password manager) and paste it into the username and password fields on a login form, or into a web-based command line interfaces asking for a password. Blocking people from pasting into authentication fields, or using a different format between the copied text and the input field (for example, \"Enter the 3rd, 4th, and 6th character of your password\"), would force the user to transcribe information and therefore fail this criterion, unless another method is available.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"two-factor-authentication\">  <h3>Two-factor authentication systems (verification codes)</h3>  <p>Beyond usernames and passwords, some sites may use two-factor authentication, asking the user to enter a verification code (also called a passcode or one-time password). A service that requires <em>manual</em> transcription of a verification code is not compliant. As with usernames and passwords, it must be possible for a user to at least paste the code (such as from a standalone third-party password manager, text message application, or software-based security key), or to allow user agents to fill in the fields automatically.</p>  <p>There are scenarios where a verification code must be received or generated on a secondary device. For example, authenticating in a web browser on a laptop requires a verification code that is sent as an SMS text message to a mobile phone. However, in most cases, it is possible for the code to then be sent directly to the primary device, where it can then be copied and pasted (for example, by copying the code on the secondary device and emailing it to the primary device, or through the use of a shared cross-device clipboard where copying content on the secondary device makes it available to paste on the primary device). Evaluating whether or not the code can be seamlessly transferred from the secondary device to the primary device is <em>outside of the scope</em> for this Success Criterion. For the purpose of evaluating Web content that relies on authentication using these types of secondary device systems, it is assumed that provisions are in place that make the code available in the user's clipboard. Evaluating this criterion therefore only requires verification that the web content does allow pasting the clipboard content in the related authentication challenge field.</p>  <p>Note that two-factor systems that do not rely on codes — including hardware authentication devices (such as YubiKey), secondary applications (either on the same primary device, or on a secondary device) that expect the user to confirm that it is indeed them trying to log in, and authentication methods provided by the user's operating system (such as Windows Hello, or Touch ID/Face ID on macOS and iOS) — are <em>not</em><a> a cognitive function test</a>.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"object-recognition\">  <h3>Object Recognition</h3>  <p>If a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/\">CAPTCHA</a> is used as part of an authentication process, there must be a method that does not include a cognitive function test, unless it meets the exception. If the test is based on something the website has set such as remembering or transcribing a word, or recognizing a picture the website provided, that would be a cognitive functional test. Recognizing objects, or a picture the user has provided is a cognitive function test; however, it is excepted at the AA level.</p>   <p>An object in this context means the general English definition (\"a material thing that can be seen and touched\") and can include vehicles and animals. If the test goes beyond recognition (e.g. multiply the number cats by the number of dogs), that does not meet the exception.</p>   <p>Some forms of object recognition may require an understanding of a particular culture. For example, taxis can appear differently in different locales. This is an issue for many people, including people with disabilities, but it is not considered an accessibility-specific issue.</p>   <p>Some CAPTCHAs and cognitive function tests used for authentication may only appear in certain situations, such as when ad blockers are present, or after repeated incorrect password entry. This criterion applies when these tests are used regardless of whether they are used every time or only triggered by specific scenarios.</p>   <p>There are a number of technologies that can be employed to prevent scripted abuse of the authentication process.</p>   <ul>  <li><a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-private-access-tokens-01.html#name-rate-limited-access\">1.1.1. Rate-limited Access</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-private-access-tokens-01.html#name-client-geo-location\">1.1.2. Client Geo-Location</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-private-access-tokens-01.html#name-private-client-authenticati\">1.1.3. Private Client Authentication</a></li>  </ul>   <p>None of these systems are 100% effective. However, they may reduce the likelihood of a CAPTCHA being displayed.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"personal-content\">  <h3>Personal Content</h3>  <p>Personal content is sometimes used as a second factor for authentication. For example, as part of account creation the user would upload a picture, and when logging in they would be asked to select that picture from several possible alternatives. Care must be taken to provide adequate security in this case, since non-legitimate users might be able to guess the correct personal content when presented with a choice.</p>   <p>Text-based personal content does not qualify for this exception as it relies on recall (rather than recognition), and transcription (rather than selecting an item). Whilst picture-based personal content will still be a barrier for some people, text based versions tend to be a much larger barrier.</p>  </section><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"hiding-content\">  <h3>Hiding characters</h3>  <p>Another factor that can contribute to cognitive load is hiding characters when typing. Although this criterion requires that users do not have to type in (transcribe) a password, there are scenarios where that is necessary such as creating a password to be saved by a password manager. Providing a feature to optionally show a password can improve the chance of success for some people with cognitive disabilities or those who have difficulties with accurately typing.</p>  </section>",

In markup languages, errors in element and attribute syntax and  failure to provide properly nested start/end tags lead to errors that  prevent user agents from parsing the content reliably.  Therefore, the Success Criterion requires that the content can be parsed using only  the rules of the formal grammar.  </p><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">  <p>The concept of \"well formed\" is close to what is required here. However, exact parsing  requirements vary amongst markup languages, and most non XML-based languages do not  explicitly define requirements for well formedness. Therefore, it was necessary to  be more explicit in the Success Criterion in order to be generally applicable to markup  languages. Because the term \"well formed\" is only defined in XML, and (because end  tags are sometimes optional) valid HTML does not require well formed code, the term  is not used in this Success Criterion.  </p>  <p>With the exception of one Success Criterion (  <a href=\"resize-text\">1.4.4: Resize Text</a>, which specifically mentions that the effect specified by the Success Criterion must  be achieved without relying on an assistive technology) authors can meet the Success  Criteria with content that assumes use of an assistive technology (or access features  in use agents) by the user, where such assistive technologies (or access features  in user agents) exist and are available to the user.  </p>  </div>",

An additional benefit is that assistive technologies for users with cognitive disabilities may achieve an alternative means of indicating (or even delaying or supressing) status messages, as preferred by the user.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">The scope of this Success Criterion is specific to changes in content that involve status messages. A <a>status message</a> is a defined term in WCAG. There are two main criteria that determine whether something meets the definition of a status message:</p><ol xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">  <li> the message <q>provides information to the user on the success or results of an action, on the waiting state of an application, on the progress of a process, or on the existence of errors;</q></li>  <li> the message is not delivered via a change in context.</li>  </ol><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">Information can be added to pages which does not meet the definition of a status message. For example, the list of results obtained from a search are not considered a status update and thus are not covered by this Success Criterion. However, brief text messages displayed <em>about</em> the completion or status of the search, such as \"Searching...\", \"18 results returned\" or \"No results returned\" would be status updates if they do not take focus. Examples of status messages are given in the section titled <a href=\"#status-examples\">Status Message Examples</a> below.</p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">This Success Criterion specifically addresses scenarios where new content is added to the page without changing the user's context. <a>Changes of context</a>, by their nature, interrupt the user by taking focus. They are already surfaced by assistive technologies, and so have already met the goal to alert the user to new content. As such, messages that involve changes of context do not need to be considered and are not within the scope of this Success Criterion. Examples of scenarios that add new content by changing the context are given in the section titled <a href=\"#excepted-examples\">Examples of Changes That Are Not Status Messages</a> below.</p><section xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" id=\"benefits\">  <h3>Benefits</h3>  <ul>  <li>When appropriate roles or properties are assigned to status messages, the new content is spoken by screen readers in such a way as to assist blind and low vision users. Most sighted users can observe text peripherally added to the viewport. Such content provides additional information without affecting the user's current point of regard. The ability of an assistive technology to announce such new important text content allows more users to benefit from an awareness of the information in an equivalent manner.</li>  <li>Assigning proper roles or properties to status messages provides possible future uses and personalization opportunities, such as the potential to be exploited by assistive technologies created for users with some cognitive disabilities. Where page authors elect to design additions to the screen which do <em>not</em> change the user's context (i.e., take focus), the information is arguably of less importance than something presented using a modal dialog, which must be acknowledged by the user. As such, depending on the user's preferences, an assistive technology may choose to delay, suppress, or transform such messages so a user is not unnecessarily interrupted; or conversely the assistive technology may highlight such messages where the user finds it optimal to do so.</li> </ul>  </section>",

Relative scaling can be calculated from  the default sizes in a similar fashion.  </p><p xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" class=\"note\">The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large  print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt).
