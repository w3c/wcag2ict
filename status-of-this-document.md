This is an Editors' Draft [change to First Public Working Draft for publication] of Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT). The intent of this work is to update the existing guidance based on new WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 success criteria.

The current draft includes guidance for WCAG 2.1 success criteria. Guidance on WCAG 2.2 success criteria will be added later this year as WCAG 2.2 becomes a W3C Recommendation. The next draft will also address open issues on WCAG 2.0 criteria. 

The group is seeking feedback on the following aspects:

- New added guidance for WCAG 2.1 success criteria and glossary term definitions
- Updates to the closed functionality guidance for new WCAG 2.1 success criteria

The group is already aware of formatting differences in how quoted passages from WCAG are included in comparison to the previous WCAG2ICT Working Group Note.

Currently there are known issues in the quoted content from WCAG and Understanding Intent sections:

- Anchor links from the included WCAG content to sections that do not exist in the WCAG2ICT document don't work
- The words "Note" and "Example" are missing from notes and examples of quoted WCAG passages
- The left bar that is present for included WCAG guidelines and success criteria is not present for the included Intent sections from the Understanding document.

The group is currently working on updates to the format, styling, and linking for these passages, and expects to refine these in a future draft.
