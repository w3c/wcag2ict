This is a W3C Group Note on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT). The purpose of this work is to update the previous WCAG2ICT Note's guidance to include changes made in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.
To comment, file an issue in the [W3C WCAG2ICT](https://github.com/w3c/wcag2icct/) GitHub repository. Create separate GitHub issues for each topic, rather than commenting on multiple topics in a single issue. It is free to create a GitHub account to file issues. If filing issues in GitHub is not feasible, send email to public-agwg-comments@w3.org (comment archive).
