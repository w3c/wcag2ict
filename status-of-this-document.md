The current draft includes guidance for all of the WCAG 2 success criteria from WCAG 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2. 

The group is seeking feedback on the following aspects that were added or have substantial changes in this draft:

- Guidance for WCAG 2.2 success criteria and glossary term definitions added by this draft
- Updates to the closed functionality guidance in the [Comments on Closed Functionality](#comments-on-closed-functionality) and [Appendix A. Success Criteria Problematic for Closed Functionality](#success-criteria-problematic-for-closed-functionality) sections
- WCAG2ICT key term definitions added in this draft: [menu-driven interface](#menu-driven-interface), [closed functionality](#closed-functionality)
