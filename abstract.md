This document, “Guidance on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)” describes how the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) versions 2.0 \[\[WCAG20\]\], 2.1 \[\[WCAG21\]\], and 2.2 \[\[WCAG22\]\] principles, guidelines, and Success Criteria can be applied to non-web Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), specifically to non-web documents and software. It provides informative guidance (guidance that is not normative and does not set requirements).

This document is part of a series of technical and educational documents published by the [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](http://www.w3.org/WAI/) and available from the [WCAG2ICT Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/non-web-ict/).
